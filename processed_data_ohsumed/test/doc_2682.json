  "text": "Isolation of preferentially expressed genes in the kidneys of hypertensive rats.\n By differential hybridization, three complementary DNAs designated as S3, S2, and SA were isolated, and the corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were differentially expressed between the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.\n S3 is identical to cytochrome P450 IV A2.\n SA encoded a protein of 546 amino acid residues, and its carboxyl terminal region had a slight homology to luciferase.\n No homologous sequence has been reported in S2 sequences.\n S3 mRNA was about four times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 28-day-old SHR than in those of age-matched WKY rats, but there was no difference at age 16 weeks.\n A low NaCl diet positively modulated the expression of the S3 gene.\n S2 mRNA was almost undetectable in the kidneys of 28-day-old WKY rats but was clearly detected in those of age-matched SHR.\n The expression level of S2 mRNA in the livers of 16-week-old SHR was about five times higher than that of age-matched WKY rats.\n The expression of S2 mRNA in the livers was modulated by dietary NaCl and captopril.\n SA mRNA was more than 10 times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY rats from age 4 weeks.\n With the administration of captopril, the expressions of SA mRNA in the livers of SHR were positively modulated.\n Because these three genes are not only differentially expressed between SHR and WKY rats but also related to sodium metabolism or blood pressure control, the identification of these genes may provide important probes to examine the mechanisms of hypertension.",
