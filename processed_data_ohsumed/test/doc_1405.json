  "text": "Phospholipase C activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.\n Phospholipase C (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride.\n Bacterial production of phospholipase C may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms.\n Use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase C activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract.\n Multiple aerobic (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase C activity.\n Phospholipase C-producing isolates included strains of Bacteroides fragilis, B.\n bivius, B.\n thetaiotaomicron, Gardnerella vaginalis, and group B streptococcus.\n Phospholipase C activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity.\n Phospholipase C production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in some instances of preterm birth.",
