  "text": "Simple renal cysts in children: diagnosis and follow-up with US.\n To assess the sonographic frequency of simple renal cysts in children, the authors retrospectively reviewed the results of abdominal sonographic studies of 16,102 children performed over a 5-year period between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 1989.\n Patients with abnormal renal function, dysplastic kidneys, or a family history of polycystic kidney disease were excluded from the study.\n The authors' review of the sonograms revealed 37 simple cysts in 35 patients (0.22%); the cysts were evenly distributed by age and sex and measured from 0.3 to 7.0 cm in maximum diameter.\n Sixteen cysts (43%) were in the upper pole of the right kidney.\n Follow-up sonographic studies of 23 cysts in 22 patients for up to 5 years showed no change in size in 17 cysts (74%).\n The largest cyst was drained percutaneously; all other cysts were managed conservatively.\n No patient showed deterioration of renal function.\n Therefore, the authors concluded that in a pediatric patient demonstrating normal renal function, no further intervention is necessary when a simple renal cyst is identified at sonography.",
