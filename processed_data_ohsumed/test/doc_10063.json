Clinical and immunologic features, treatment, and prognosis.\n A 2 1/2-month-old female infant presented with multiple tense bullae on the hands and feet.\n Analysis of biopsy specimens confirmed our clinical impression of childhood bullous pemphigoid.\n Confirmatory data included type IV collagen mapping of the basement membrane zone, a readily available technique that helps distinguish childhood bullous pemphigoid from childhood epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.\n To our knowledge, our patient is the youngest described with childhood bullous pemphigoid, and we use this opportunity to review the literature and examine the clinical and immunologic features, treatment, and prognosis of this rare childhood immunobullous disorder.",
