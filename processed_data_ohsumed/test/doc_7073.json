  "text": "The \"numb cheek-limp lower lid\" syndrome.\n A patient developed isolated numbness, 1st confined to the lateral nose and upper lip, but later involving the cheek, lower lip, upper gingiva, and the palate.\n This numbness was later associated with paresis of the muscles of the upper lip and angle of the mouth and with ipsilateral lower lid droop (the \"numb cheek-limp lower lid\" syndrome).\n Squamous cell carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the infraorbital nerve and distal branches of the facial nerve.\n Cheek numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness may herald a neoplasm affecting the infraorbital nerve and distal facial nerve branches.",
