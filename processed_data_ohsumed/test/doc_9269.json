  "text": "Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis.\n Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis have occurred primarily through the use of experimental animal models.\n These models have proven to be particularly valuable in experimental bacterial meningitis, focusing on the bacterial virulence factors responsible for the initiation of infections, CNS invasion, and induction of SAS inflammation.\n Recent studies have examined the formation of host inflammatory cytokines in response to these virulence factors.\n These cytokines may be responsible for many of the pathophysiologic consequences of bacterial meningitis (eg.\n increased BBB permeability, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure).\n Meningitis due to C.\n neoformans occurs most commonly in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS), and the depletion of T helper cells in AIDS patients may allow unrestricted cryptococcal growth.\n Viral meningitis is an illness of low prevalence when compared with the overall occurrence of viral infections at other sites.\n CNS infection usually occurs by means of traversal across barriers that normally exclude viral invasion of the CNS, primarily through hematogenous dissemination from initial sites of infection.\n These advances in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial, fungal, and viral meningitis may lead to the development of innovative treatment strategies for these disorders.",
