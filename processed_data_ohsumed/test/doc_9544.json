  "text": "Sternocleidomastoid muscle transfer and superficial musculoaponeurotic system plication in the prevention of Frey's syndrome \n Parotidectomy may be associated with a significant depression in the retromandibular region and a significant incidence of gustatory sweating (Frey's syndrome).\n Superiorly and inferiorly based sternocleidomastoid flaps and posterior plication of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system were evaluated for their ability to ameliorate both consequences.\n Sixteen patients with sternocleidomastoid flaps and 16 patients with superficial musculoaponeurotic system plication were compared to a control group of 104 patients.\n The incidence of Frey's syndrome was 47.1% in the control group, 12.5% (P = 0.025) in the sternocleidomastoid flap group, and 0% (P = 0.005) in the superficial musculoaponeurotic system plication group.\n The surgical techniques are described.\n The prevalence of Frey's syndrome is discussed with respect to age, sex, radiation therapy, and the type of parotidectomy performed.\n The indications and contraindications of the three surgical techniques are described.",
