  "text": "Intraperitoneal phosphate administration in hungry bone syndrome.\n Hypophosphatemia complicating parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure is usually corrected by the oral or intravenous routes.\n We present a case in which those methods of treatment were not possible, and the phosphate was administered intraperitoneally.\n Phosphate was added as one molar sodium diphosphate solution to the dialysis fluid.\n In our case the procedure was well tolerated, phosphate blood levels were rapidly corrected, no alterations in calcium, magnesium or other parameters were detected and the patient was discharged in good condition.\n In selected cases of hungry bone syndrome after parathyroidectomy, intraperitoneal phosphate can be used safely.",
