  "text": "Central corpectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a consecutive series with long-term follow-up evaluation.\n Since 1984, a consecutive series of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has been treated by central corpectomy and strut grafting.\n This report focuses on 40 cases operated on between 1984 and 1987 and followed from 2 to 5 years.\n The perioperative complication rate was 47.5%, with a 7.5% incidence of persistent sequelae: severe C-5 radiculopathy in one patient, swallowing dysfunction in one, and hypoglossal nerve palsy in one.\n No single factor (age, duration of symptoms, or severity of myelopathy) was absolutely predictive of outcome; however, syndromes of short duration had the best likelihood of cure.\n Similar outcomes were associated, individually, with long duration of symptoms, age over 70 years, and severe myelopathy.\n After factoring a 5% regression of improvement, the long-term cure rate was 57.5% and the failure rate was 15%.\n Myelopathy worsening was not documented.",
