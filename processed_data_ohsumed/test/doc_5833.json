  "text": "The use of a tourniquet when plating tibial fractures.\n Sixty closed fractures of the tibia were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with plates and screws.\n Half the operations were performed with a thigh tourniquet and half without.\n In the tourniquet group, there were six cases with erythema and induration of the wound; in the other group there were no such complications.\n Despite negative bacterial cultures, superficial infection of the inflamed wounds was suspected.\n It is suggested that a tourniquet may predispose tissues to infection, and its use is not recommended during operations for internal fixation of the tibia.",
