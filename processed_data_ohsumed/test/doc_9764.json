  "text": "Cluster headache: the effect of low oxygen saturation \n The present study concerns the possible relationship between hypoxia and the generation of cluster headache attacks.\n Fifteen controls and 25 cluster headache patients were studied.\n The patients were allocated into two groups according to cluster headache stage, i.e.\n cluster or remission period.\n During the tests, all the subjects were asked to inhale 12% oxygen (88% N2) for 30 min, and the decreasing oxygen saturation (SaO2%) was monitored.\n Patients in the remission period showed nearly the same decrement of SaO2% as controls.\n At the end of the test, patients in the bout showed significantly less reduction of SaO2% than the controls.\n In 5 patients, the test was carried out both in and outside the cluster periods.\n The tendency to less decrement in oxygen saturation in the cluster phase was as marked with this comparison, but the difference between the groups was not significant, probably partly due to the low number of tests carried out.\n Only one patient got a typical attack.\n It seems that hypoxia of this magnitude per se is not the cause of attacks.\n The different pattern with respect to SaO2% following 12% O2 inhalation in cluster headache may be due to an abnormality in central regulation and/or chemoreceptor sensitivity.",
