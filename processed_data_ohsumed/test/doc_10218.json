  "text": "Scanning acoustic microscopy of neoplastic and inflammatory cutaneous tissue specimens.\n Acoustic microscopy utilizes high frequency ultrasound to generate microscopic images.\n The current study was designed to examine representative disorders of the skin by use of a reflective scanning acoustic microscope (R-SAM), and to determine whether the obtainable resolution was sufficient to render a microscopic diagnosis.\n An Olympus UH3 Scanning Acoustic Microscope was utilized with lenses producing burst wave frequencies at 600 and 800 MHz (600 and 800 million cylces/sec).\n Cutaneous tissue specimens representing 12 different neoplastic and inflammatory disorders were examined.\n Acoustic images of unstained sections were compared with conventional light microscopic study of sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin.\n In most neoplasms examined, it was possible to make a specific diagnosis primarily from low magnification pattern analysis.\n Although individual cells could be visualized, cytologic atypia was poorly defined.\n In the inflammatory disorders, a specific diagnosis was possible in all but bullous pemphigoid and lichen planus, because the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate was difficult to determine.\n The advantages of the R-SAM include the capability of producing an acoustic profile of the tissue and the future possibility of in situ diagnosis.",
