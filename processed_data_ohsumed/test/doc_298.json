  "text": "Tracheoesophageal anastomosis for intractable aspiration pneumonia.\n Permanent tracheostomy and tracheoesophageal anastomosis were performed as a means of surgical intervention for the treatment of intractable aspiration pneumonia.\n Conventional methods of tracheoesophageal anastomosis have entailed various problems.\n The improved method devised by us uses the special histological features and enables safe and reliable anastomosis.\n By this method, the tracheal perichondrium is retained and the strength of the anastomosed portion of the trachea is maintained, the failure of sutures due to tension on the anastomotic site being prevented.\n Also, reanastomosis can be performed after the cure of primary disease.",
