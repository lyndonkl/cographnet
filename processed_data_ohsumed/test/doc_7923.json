  "text": "Pigmented spindle cell naevus.\n We report 22 cases of pigmented spindle cell naevus (PSCN).\n The usual appearance of these naevi is that of a heavily pigmented papule found mostly on the legs of young patients.\n Histologically, PSCN was characterized by symmetrical proliferation of spindle-shaped pigmented melanocytes grouped in large junctional nests.\n Pagetoid spread of single cells in the overlying epidermis was frequently found.\n In our opinion, PSCN is a distinctive benign acquired melanocytic naevus that in the past has been frequently misdiagnosed as atypical Spitz naevi or malignant melanoma.",
