  "text": "Dislocation of the knee.\n The results of treatment for vascular and ligamentous injuries in 17 patients who suffered complete dislocation of the knee were reviewed.\n Eight patients had 23 associated injuries.\n All nine patients who had injuries of the popliteal artery had arterial reconstruction with saphenous vein bypass grafts, which were successful in eight (89%).\n Intraoperative arteriography after vascular repair showed a narrowed anastomosis requiring revision in two (22%) of the nine patients and distal thrombi requiring removal in five (55%) patients.\n Delay in arterial repair was responsible for the one failure.\n Eleven patients had satisfactory results after early open ligament repair.\n The results were less favorable in the patients not treated with early ligament repair.",
