  "text": "Helicobacter pylori and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease.\n The relationship between H.\n pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown.\n We investigated the frequency of H.\n pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H.\n pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n H.\n pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H.\n pylori.\n We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, median age 51.\n Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H.\n pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05).\n Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr, median 35.2.\n Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7.\n Acid secretion was lower in the H.\n pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6, and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7, for H.\n pylori infected vs uninfected patients, respectively).\n The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05).\n The present results indicate that H.\n pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n The association of a reduced BAO with H.\n pylori suggests that these findings may be related.",
