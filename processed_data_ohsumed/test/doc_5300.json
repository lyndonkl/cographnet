  "text": "Neuropsychological aspects of learning disabilities in epilepsy.\n Cognitive impairment is regarded as the link between epileptic conditions and the inability to learn in school.\n The neuropsychological approach to learning disabilities in epilepsy, therefore, first concentrates on analyzing the differential effects of epileptic factors on cognitive function.\n The impact of seizure activity, localization of epileptogenic foci, and antiepileptic treatment on cognitive functioning can be evaluated based upon the results of continuous assessment with a computerized neuropsychological test system.\n Second, learning disabilities may be evaluated on observations made during classroom performance.\n Three issues seem to predominate in learning studies among disabled children with epilepsy: test-retest variability, deterioration, and the supposed specificity of the learning disabilities.",
