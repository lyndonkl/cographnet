  "text": "Barium sulfate bronchography. Report of a complication.\n Alveolarization of the barium sulfate and subsequent retention of barium sulfate for years was demonstrated in three patients in whom dilute suspension of barium sulfate in water was used for bronchography.\n Pathologic examination in one patient showed barium sulfate within macrophages in the alveolar spaces and walls and in the perivascular and peribronchial interstitium.\n Since the residual barium sulfate interferes with imaging procedures of the lungs, it represents an unwanted event in patients with pulmonary disease.\n High-resolution computed tomography is the preferred method of evaluating for bronchiectasis.\n If bronchogram is performed, it should be performed after bronchoscopy using oily propyliodone (Dionosil).",
