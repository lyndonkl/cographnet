  "text": "Association of germ cell tumors and Hodgkin's disease.\n Two patients presented with synchronous Hodgkin's disease and testicular germ cell neoplasms.\n Both patients are in complete remission following treatment with multidrug chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n Despite epidemiologic similarities between Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer, only 13 cases of their association in the same patient have been reported in the literature, and in all those instances the tumors occurred metachronously.\n However, the very rare occurrence of synchronous presentation suggests a possible common pathogenetic factor in our 2 patients.",
