  "text": "Accumulation of erythrocyte nucleotides and their pattern in lead workers.\n Nucleotides in erythrocytes of lead-exposed subjects were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n Most of the pyrimidine levels correlated well with blood lead concentrations (Pb-B) and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) activity.\n Highly significant correlations were found between Pb-B and uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose (UDPG), cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP), or CDP-choline (CDPC).\n The levels of these compounds were sharply elevated when P5N activity was reduced to levels less than 7 mumole/h.g hemoglobin (Hb), which corresponded to a Pb-B of 60 micrograms/100 g.\n Therefore, concentration of these nucleotides may provide a useful index of lead poisoning.\n Adenosine 5'-triphospate (ATP) concentrations were correlated negatively with Pb-B, whereas adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) concentrations were correlated positively with Pb-B.\n These results suggest that lead affects not only pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism but also purine nucleotide metabolism (energy production system).",
