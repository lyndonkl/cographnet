  "text": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n With more than 500,000 cholecystectomies performed per year, great interest has developed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n The procedure offers the patient reduced hospital stay, faster return to work, less pain, and improved cosmetic results.\n In September 1988, we developed a technique of performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy that we have now performed in more than 800 cases with good results.\n The technique allows the surgeon to fully evaluate the common duct via operative cholangiography and has allowed us to use a laparoscopic approach in all patients who were candidates for cholecystectomy.\n The technique offers a minimally invasive alternative to open cholecystectomy.",
