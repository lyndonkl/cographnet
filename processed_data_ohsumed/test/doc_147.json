  "text": "Assessment of nasal patency by rhinoscopic measurement of cross sectional nasal airway area: correlation with subjective nasal symptoms.\n Assessment of nasal patency by the recording of nasal symptom scores was compared with an objective method of determining nasal airway area using a fiberoptic rhinoscope.\n Sixty patients with active allergic rhinitis and nasal congestion requiring treatment were studied.\n Nasal symptoms were recorded and nasal airway area was measured before and at fixed time intervals after administration of either pseudoephedrine or oxymetazoline.\n Both methods detected a decongestant response to both drugs, and the symptom of congestion correlated with the measured nasal airway area.\n Rhinoscopic measurement of cross sectional nasal airway area is an objective method that may be used to complement other methods for evaluation of nasal patency.",
