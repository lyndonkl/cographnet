  "text": "Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis.\n Transarterial hepatic embolization was attempted in 10 and succeeded in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by extensive celiac arterial stenosis.\n All catheterization was done through the femoral artery.\n In six cases, the tip of the catheter (2.5-F ball-tip microcatheter in three cases, 4-F ball-tip supple catheter in three cases) was placed in the proper hepatic artery through the pancreaticoduodenal collaterals.\n In three cases, a ball-tip microcatheter was injected from the guiding catheter, which was placed in a pinhole of the celiac trunk.\n These techniques involving flow-guided ball-tip catheters are of great value for hepatic arterial catheterization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis.",
