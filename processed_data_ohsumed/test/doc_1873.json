  "text": "Cyclic-AMP binding proteins in the head and neck.\n Results are presented of a preliminary study in which cAMP binding activity was measured in 34 specimens from a variety of head and neck sites.\n A wide range of cAMP binding protein levels was detected in all tissues assessed.\n There appeared to be a subgroup of parotid adenomas with increased cAMP binding activity.\n The biological significance of these proteins remains to be determined and their relationship to tumour growth in the head and neck is likely to be complex.",
