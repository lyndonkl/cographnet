A case report.\n This is the first reported case of simultaneously occurring pelvic splenosis and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.\n No other congenital or anatomic abnormalities were observed in the patient, and she had no history of abdominal trauma or surgery.\n Endometriosis was suspected initially during laparoscopy for pelvic pain.\n After tissue removal at laparotomy, the histologic evaluation established the diagnosis of splenosis.\n Biopsy at laparoscopy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis in the presence of a congenital anomaly and lesions suspected of being endometriotic.",
