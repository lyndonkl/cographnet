  "text": "Recurrent renal cell carcinoma arising in Wilms' tumor.\n A 19-month-old black girl had a radical nephrectomy for a Wilms' tumor that contained areas of epithelium indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma.\n She was treated with chemotherapy but subsequently had pulmonary metastases develop and massive abdominal recurrence.\n The recurrent tumor was histologically renal cell carcinoma with no identifiable Wilms' tumor elements.\n The child died with recurrent and metastatic tumor 13 months after nephrectomy.\n Pathologic, immunoperoxidase, and flow cytometric studies of this unusual case are presented.",
