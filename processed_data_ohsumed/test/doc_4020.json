  "text": "Umbilical cord hematoma following diagnostic funipuncture.\n Major complications associated with funipuncture have been reported but are rare.\n This is a report of a diagnostic funipuncture performed on a 29-week fetus with a single umbilical artery and multiple malformations.\n Immediately after the procedure, a voluminous hematoma developed at the site of needle insertion in association with a severe fetal bradycardia.\n Fetal death was confirmed within 5 minutes of needle insertion.\n It is hypothesized that the risk of complications of funipuncture may vary according to the clinical indication for the procedure and may be increased in the presence of certain fetal malformations.\n The rapid evolution of complications, as occurred in the present case, underlines the importance of having a clear plan of management in the event of mishap and discussing this plan with the parents before undertaking diagnostic funipuncture.",
