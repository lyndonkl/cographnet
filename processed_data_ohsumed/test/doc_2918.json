  "text": "Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\n Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).\n Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine.\n It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size.\n Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized.\n Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired.\n When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction.\n In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output.\n Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness.\n Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors.\n Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate.\n Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration.\n The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation.",
