  "text": "Impact of nonoperative therapy on the clinical management of peripheral arterial disease.\n Nonoperative therapy includes conservative noninterventional modalities and the endovascular interventional modalities of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and a variety of laser systems and atherectomy devices.\n The role and impact of all nonoperative treatments are considered in the perspectives of the natural history of lower-extremity arteriosclerosis and its present surgical (operative) treatment.\n Nonoperative treatments may replace and/or facilitate surgical treatment in operative candidates.\n Nonoperative methods may also justify treatment in patients who cannot or should not be subjected to surgery.\n Facts and opinions relating to these uses of nonoperative treatments are presented, and the qualifications and credentialing of individuals who should be treating patients with lower-extremity ischemia resulting from peripheral arteriosclerosis are discussed.",
