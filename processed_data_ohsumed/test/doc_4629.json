  "text": "Isotonic high-sodium oral rehydration solution for increasing sodium absorption in patients with short-bowel syndrome.\n We compared the effect of a standard oral rehydration solution and a high-sodium polymeric-glucose solution on sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome.\n Six patients with high jejunostomy were tested in a random order with the standard solution or a solution containing maltodextrins (18 g Glucidex 12/L) enriched with 2.5 g NaCl/L.\n Solutions were administered via a nasogastric tube at a rate of 2 mL/min.\n Jejunal effluent was collected during an 8-h period.\n The net 8-h fluid absorption was not significantly different in the two periods.\n Glucose absorption was greater than 90% of the administered amount for both solutions.\n Net sodium absorption was greater for the maltodextrin solution than for the standard solution (56 +/- 12 vs 24 +/- 20 mmol, P less than 0.05).\n We conclude that replacement of glucose with maltodextrins and addition of sodium in the standard oral rehydration solution results in improved sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome.",
