  "text": "The effect of chemotherapy on growth in the skeletally immature individual.\n One hundred twenty-two children with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma were studied to assess the effect of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final stature.\n No deviations from the height distributions of a normal population were noted at diagnosis.\n There was a marked retardation of linear growth during the year of intensive chemotherapy.\n Only 15% of the patients grew at the expected rate during that year.\n The distribution of nutritional status scores was significantly different at the end of the first year than at baseline.\n The distribution of ultimate height scores was significantly different than the baseline distribution.\n The overall final distribution was also significantly different from the normal population expectation.\n Any absolute difference in height, however, is likely to be small.\n The subgroups that were observed to full adult stature showed mean heights of 162 cm for girls and 176 cm for boys.",
