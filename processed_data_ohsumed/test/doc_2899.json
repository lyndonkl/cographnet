  "text": "Computed tomography in the evaluation of the aorta in patients sustaining blunt chest trauma.\n Computed tomography is used with increasing frequency to evaluate blunt chest trauma.\n Since traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) is a rapidly lethal condition, unnecessary CT scanning may not be justified.\n To determine the accuracy of chest CT scanning for TAR, we reviewed 17 patients who underwent both chest CT scanning and aortography.\n Five patients had TAR by aortography.\n CT scanning yielded three true positives and two false negatives.\n In 12 patients with a negative aortogram, CT scanning recorded four false positives and eight true negatives.\n The specificity was 23% and the sensitivity was 83% compared with aortography.\n The overall accuracy for CT scanning was 53%.\n From these data we conclude that in the presence of an unstable patient or where there is a strong clinical suspicion of TAR the patient should proceed directly to aortography.",
