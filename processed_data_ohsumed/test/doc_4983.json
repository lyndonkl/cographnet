  "text": "Window operation: an alternative treatment method for Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses \n Recently, we developed the \"window operation\" as a more effective way to treat Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses.\n The window operation was used to treat 25 Bartholin cysts and 22 Bartholin abscesses during a 3-year period from October 1, 1986 to September 30, 1989.\n Under local anesthesia, a small piece of skin including the cyst wall was excised in an oval shape, and suturing was performed along the excised margin.\n Postoperative antibiotics were given in cases of acute inflammation.\n A new mucocutaneous junction was observed at the 4-week postoperative checkup.\n No complications or recurrences have been observed during the study period.\n The window operation can be an alternative method of treatment for Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses.",
