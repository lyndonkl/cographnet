  "text": "Outcome of antenatally diagnosed pelviureteric junction hydronephrosis.\n Over a 6-year period, in a series of 107 consecutive patients with antenatally detected urological anomalies, 45 had pelviureteric junction (PUJ) hydronephrosis (66 units).\n Of these, 24 units (36%) had obstructive (group I) and 42 (64%) non-obstructive hydronephrosis (group II).\n Significantly compromised renal function was found only in group I.\n Treatment in group I was by an early pyeloplasty; in group II the patients were kept under close review.\n During the 6-year period, 2 units (5%) in group II, deteriorated, 13 (31%) improved and 27 (64%) were unchanged.\n These results suggest that early in life, antenatally diagnosed PUJ hydronephrosis without obstruction may be a relatively benign condition but will require long-term follow-up in order to determine the natural history of the condition.",
