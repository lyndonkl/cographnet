  "text": "Posttraumatic torticollis.\n We report six cases of torticollis precipitated by neck trauma.\n The dystonia began 1 to 4 days after the trauma and differed clinically from idiopathic torticollis by marked limitation of range of motion, lack of improvement after sleep (\"honeymoon period\"), and absence of geste antagonistique.\n Worsening with action was not present; nor was there improvement with support as seen with idiopathic torticollis.\n Onset of pain immediately after the trauma and marked spasms of the paracervical muscles were other predominant features.\n Anticholinergic therapy was without benefit; however, some improvement occurred with botulinum toxin injection.\n It is concluded that torticollis can be caused by peripheral trauma and that it has unique clinical characteristics.",
