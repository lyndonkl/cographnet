  "text": "Gross and microscopic changes in the viscera induced by photodynamic therapy applied to the lower abdomen of intact rats.\n Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer.\n Preferential retention of the photosensitizer by malignant tissue has been considered a hallmark of this treatment modality.\n However, photosensitivity can be observed in normal, non-neoplastic tissues, and the present study investigated the effects of PDT treatment on the abdomen of intact rats.\n A circular region (1 cm diameter) on the shaved abdomen of Fischer rats, pretreated 24 h prior with Photofrin II, was irradiated for 30 min at 632 nm.\n Control animals received either photoradiation or Photofrin II administration.\n Subsequent lesions were observed in the irradiated skin, its associated abdominal wall, and the underlying gut in rats receiving Photofrin II and laser irradiation.\n All tissues were not equally sensitive to PDT treatment.\n Gut lesions were consistently more severe than were skin and abdominal wall injuries.\n By 24 hr after treatment, the gut manifested a transmural hemorrhagic necrosis, while the irradiated skin and abdominal wall were edematous, with an inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and around occasional swollen myocytes.\n These results indicate that superficial lesions induced by PDT may not be reliable indicators of the extent of deeper PDT tissue damage.\n Further, it may be possible to take advantage of this discrepancy in tissue sensitivity and treat deep tissues through less sensitive superficial tissues.",
