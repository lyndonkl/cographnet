  "text": "Total gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the elderly.\n Of 1070 patients with gastric cancers, 292 patients underwent total gastrectomy during 13 years.\n Sixty patients were more than 70 years of age and 232 were under 69 years.\n The incidence of well-differentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas was the same in the elderly patients, whereas the latter was dominant in the young patients.\n However, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding location, size, macroscopic patterns, extent of lymph metastases, or stage classification.\n The rates of preoperative surgical risk factors were significantly different between the two groups (p less than 0.01): 90.0% for the elderly and 34.9% for the young patients.\n However, the rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality were 31.7% and 3.3% for the elderly and 24.1% and 1.3% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference.\n The 5- and 10-year survival rates after curative total gastrectomy were 48.6% and 23.2% for the elderly compared with 49.4% and 33.6% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference.\n A 5-year survival rate after noncurative operation was 0% for the elderly and 6.4% for the young patients.\n These results indicate that, when performed for cure, total gastrectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy can provide good long-term results for elderly, as well as young, patients.",
