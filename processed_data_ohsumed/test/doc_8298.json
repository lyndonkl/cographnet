Two different sub-groups.\n Chondrosarcomas arising from soft tissues are rare.\n Two different varieties are described, myxoid and mesenchymal.\n We have collected nine cases of the tumour, five myxoid and four mesenchymal, from a review of 513 cases of chondrosarcoma seen between 1904 and 1988.\n We report the principal clinical, radiographical and histological differences between the two varieties and discuss their surgical treatment and prognosis.",
