  "text": "The no-scalpel vasectomy.\n A refined method of delivering the vas deferens for vasectomy has been developed and used in China since 1974.\n This method eliminates the scalpel, results in fewer hematomas and infections, and leaves a smaller wound than conventional techniques.\n An extracutaneous fixation ring clamp encircles and firmly secures the vas without penetrating the skin.\n A sharp curved hemostat punctures and dilates the scrotal skin and vas sheath.\n The vas is delivered, cleaned and occluded by the surgeon's preferred technique.\n The contralateral vas is delivered through the same opening.\n The puncture wound contracts to about 2 mm., is not visible to the man and requires no sutures for closure.\n The reported incidence of hematoma in 179,741 men followed in China was 0.09%.\n No hematomas or infections were identified in the first 273 procedures performed by a surgeon in the United States.\n The operating time in China and for the last 50 United States procedures has ranged from 5 to 11 minutes.\n The disadvantage of the technique is the hand-on training and number of cases necessary to gain proficiency.\n However, the advantages for surgeons and patients should enhance the popularity of vasectomy.",
