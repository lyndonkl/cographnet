  "text": "Cisplatin, continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil, and intermediate-dose methotrexate in the treatment of unresectable non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n Forty-one patients with unresectable non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCCL) were treated with cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d for 5 days as a daily bolus injection, 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/d by continuous infusion for 5 days, and intermediate-dose methotrexate 200 mg/m2 on days 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle (PFM).\n One complete and 23 partial responses were observed, yielding an overall response rate of 60%.\n There was no significant difference in response rates based on histologic subtype or extent of disease (locally unresectable versus metastatic).\n Median duration of response was 6 months, and the median survival of all patients was 10 months.\n Two patients with unresectable disease at presentation became resectable after chemotherapy and remain disease-free at 46+ and 53+ months.\n Toxicity was modest, with oral mucositis the major adverse effect.\n Clinically important neutropenia was uncommon.\n PFM is an active regimen in NSCCL and deserves further study in the \"neoadjuvant\" setting.",
