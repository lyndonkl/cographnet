  "text": "A trilaminar skin coverage technique for treatment of severe degloving injuries of the extremities and torso.\n A 60 percent degloving injury involving the torso and lower extremities of an 8-year-old boy is described.\n Successful management employed the use of a new trilaminar skin coverage technique.\n With the avulsed flap still attached to its bed, a 0.14-inch split-thickness graft of epithelium and superficial dermis is raised with a power-driven dermatome.\n From the same harvest site, one level deeper, a second layer consisting of split-thickness dermis (0.14 inch) is taken.\n Both the first and second layers are meshed and expanded.\n The remaining degloved flap is excised and, on a sterile bench, defatted to produce a third layer of deep dermis.\n In our case, this third layer was ultimately lost, but it functioned well as a temporary biologic dressing.\n Depending on donor-site morbidity, other potential applications of this method (i.e., major burn injuries) may be feasible.",
