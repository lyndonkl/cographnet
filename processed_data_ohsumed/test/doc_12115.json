  "text": "IgE-dependent cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes.\n These studies demonstrate the IgE-dependent production of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha by circulating blood monocytes.\n IL-1 beta production was demonstrated biologically as the stimulation of proliferation of the cloned IL-1-dependent murine T cell line D10.G4.1 in the presence of a submitogenic concentration of PHA.\n In a representative experiment, 3H-thymidine uptake increased from 57826 cpm in the presence of supernatants obtained from unstimulated cells to 200774 cpm with supernatants from monocytes stimulated by IgE/alpha IgE immune complexes.\n By ELISA, IgE complexes increased IL-1 beta production from 0.54 +/- 0.06 ng (per 10(6) monocytes) to 2.60 +/- 0.62 ng (p less than 0.01; mean of eight experiments) and TNF-alpha production from 0.17 +/- 0.10 ng to 3.00 +/- 0.54 ng (p less than 0.01; mean of four experiments).\n No IL-1 alpha secretion was observed.\n RNA hybridization analysis demonstrated that IL-1 beta production represented de novo synthesis of the cytokine.\n Stimulated RNA production was observed after a minimal 1/2-h incubation and was maximal at 2 h.\n The IgE-dependent secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytic cells may contribute to the inflammation characteristic of allergic responses.",
