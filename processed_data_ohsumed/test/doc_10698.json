  "text": "Immunopathological response to loose cementless acetabular components.\n The membranes surrounding seven loose cementless acetabular implants were shown to contain polyethylene particles, birefringent in polarised light.\n Three of these implants were made of titanium alloy and the membranes around these contained titanium particles as well.\n There was no metallosis around the four implants made of chromium-cobalt-steel alloy.\n Both titanium and polyethylene particles caused migration, adherence and phagocytosis of CD11b-positive, peroxidase-negative macrophages.\n There were no histological signs of activation of the specific immune response; neither interleukin-2 receptor-positive activated T cells nor PCA-1 plasmablasts/plasma cells were present in the tissues.\n In cases of simple loosening, resident mesenchymal fibroblast-like cells were active.\n In aggressive granulomatosis, there were many macrophages and multinucleated giant cells but little fibroblast reaction.\n The clinical relevance of the findings is that the use of cementless prostheses is not a guarantee against adverse tissue reactions.",
