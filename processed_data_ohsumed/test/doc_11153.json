  "text": "Accuracy of portable blood glucose monitoring. Effect of glucose level and prandial state \n Glucose was determined on capillary and venous blood samples from 274 adult diabetics by three different methodologies: the Glucoscan 2000 and Accu-Check II portable glucose meters (capillary) and the Kodak Ektachem 700 analyzer (venous).\n Both glucose meters correlated significantly with the Ektachem results.\n A significant positive bias was found for the Glucoscan compared with Ektachem, not found with the Accu-Check II.\n The Accu-Check performed better than the Glucoscan at venous plasma glucose levels less than 1 g/L.\n The mean error of Glucoscan determinations was significantly greater and biased positive when the measurement was performed within 4 hours of eating, whereas no such effect was seen with Accu-Check error.\n Multiple regression analysis revealed that the Glucoscan measurement was independently influenced by both venous plasma glucose and prandial state, whereas the Accu-Check II measurement was not dependent on either variable.\n The within-run precision for both glucose meters were comparable.",
