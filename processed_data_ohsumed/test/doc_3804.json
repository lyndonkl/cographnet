  "text": "Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy: a method to improve hearing in open technique tympanoplasty.\n Canal wall-down technique tympanoplasty was indicated in about 41 per cent of our cases with chronic suppurative otitis media.\n In this series done during the last four years, of 576 tympanoplasties, 240 cases needed type III tympanoplasty.\n In 145 cases, myringostapediopexy was carried out using temporalis fascia grafting over the head of the stapes.\n Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy was performed in the other 95 cases by using tragal cartilage and perichondrium over the stapes.\n A comparison between the results of both methods of grafting is discussed.\n Improvement in hearing was achieved after tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy.\n This method proved to be suitable for those cases which need open technique tympanoplasty.",
