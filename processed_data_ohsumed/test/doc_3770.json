  "text": "Coronary sinus occlusion: effect on ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and reactive hyperemia.\n Pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) has been shown to reduce experimental infarct size.\n To examine the role of PICSO in limiting the consequences of brief ischemia on left ventricular function, we studied the effect of PICSO in nine open-chest anesthetized dogs.\n PICSO was performed using a pump-inflated, balloon-tipped catheter in the coronary sinus until coronary sinus occlusion pressure reached a plateau (10 +/- 3 seconds).\n The balloon was then rapidly deflated (2 seconds) and the cycle was repeated.\n Regional left ventricular function in the ischemic zone was assessed by sonomicrometry.\n Coronary blood flow was measured with a flow probe around the left anterior descending artery (LAD) proximal to an occluding suture.\n Measurements were obtained at baseline, during a 3-minute LAD occlusion, and for 10 minutes of reperfusion.\n In an additional five dogs, this sequence was repeated during an infusion of adenosine at a dose that abolished reactive hyperemia following LAD occlusion.\n The addition of PICSO beginning 15 minutes prior to ischemia and continuing throughout LAD occlusion and reperfusion did not prevent, reduce, or shorten ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.\n PICSO uniformly blunted reactive hyperemia during reperfusion.\n However, PICSO also reduced coronary blood flow during maximal vasodilatation achieved by adenosine infusion prior to LAD occlusion.\n Therefore, it is likely that PICSO decreases reactive hyperemia due to mechanical factors arising from venous engorgement rather than by reducing the ischemic stimulus causing vasodilation.",
