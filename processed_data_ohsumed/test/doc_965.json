  "text": "Percutaneous rotational contact biliary lithotripsy: initial clinical results with the Kensey Nash lithotrite.\n The percutaneous rotary lithotrite introduces a new concept to fragmentation and percutaneous removal of gallstones.\n A fluid vortex is generated, pulling calculi into a high-speed blade that fragments stones to predominantly under 500 microns.\n The results of treating the first 10 patients with this instrument reveal that large stone burdens as well as small stones (2-3 mm) of any composition can be removed if the gallbladder is of sufficient size to accommodate the six-pronged basket.\n Rotation times of 7-39 minutes were required.\n Nine of 10 procedures were completed; access was lost in one case.\n One major complication occurred.\n At repeat oral cholecystography, the gallbladder was visualized after 3-6 weeks in eight of the nine patients.\n Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered from 3 to 12 months to five patients with either residual stones or aggregates.\n The hospital stay ranged from 48 to 72 hours.\n All patients (except the patient who underwent surgery) resumed light activity in 3-4 days and strenuous activity and full diet within 3 weeks.",
