  "text": "Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis after acute abdominal operation.\n Two hundred and forty-five patients who underwent acute extensive abdominal operations were randomized into three regimens to achieve optimal prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolic complications.\n All of the patients were screened by the 125I-fibrinogen uptake test for seven days and if the phlebographic findings were positive.\n Of 81 patients receiving low dose heparin, 12 had thromboembolism.\n Of 79 receiving a combination of low dose heparin and graded compression stockings, two had thromboembolism, and of 85 receiving a combination of dextran and graded compression stockings, 13 had this complication.\n This difference is significant in favor of the second treatment (p = 0.013).\n It is concluded that the combination of low dose heparin and graded compression stockings is an effective way to prevent thromboembolism after acute abdominal operations.",
