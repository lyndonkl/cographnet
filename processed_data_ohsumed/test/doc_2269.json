  "text": "Preclinical pharmacology of celiprolol: a cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist and mild vasodilator.\n Celiprolol is a new antihypertensive agent that represents a new generation of beta-blockers.\n It combines cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonism (beta 1) with a mild vasodilation via vasoselective beta-adrenergic agonism (beta 2).\n Results of animal studies show that celiprolol has beta 1-antagonist potency similar to that of propranolol and atenolol, and cardioselectivity slightly greater than that of atenolol.\n Celiprolol does not produce bronchoconstriction but has mild propranolol-resistant bronchodilatory properties in cats.\n The compound also relaxes vascular smooth muscle in a propranolol-sensitive fashion, suggesting a mechanism of beta 2-agonism.\n The beta 2-agonism results in a selective downregulation in beta 2-receptor number and response in tissue culture, as well as in peripheral tissue from celiprolol-treated volunteers.\n The decreases in beta 2-receptors are blocked by concomitant treatment with propranolol.\n Celiprolol is devoid of cardiac depressant activity and in fact has mild cardiostimulatory actions.\n The cardiostimulation is not via beta 1-stimulation, since it is not abolished by beta-blocking doses of propranolol.\n In a model of severe myocardial ischemia, celiprolol attenuates the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis and improves the regional segment function.\n These results are suggestive of myocardial protection.\n In summary, celiprolol distinguishes itself from other beta-blockers by virtue of its cardioselectivity, vasorelaxation via beta 2-agonism, and the lack of bronchoconstriction and cardiodepression.\n These properties observed in animal studies have also been documented in clinical trials.",
