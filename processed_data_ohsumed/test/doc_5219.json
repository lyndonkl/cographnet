  "text": "Levels of disability among U.S. adults with arthritis.\n This article studies the excess levels of disability experienced by persons with arthritis, compared to persons without the disease.\n The data set is the Supplement on Aging (1984 National Health Interview Survey); it has information for a national probability sample of community-dwelling persons ages 55 + (N = 16,148).\n (1) Arthritis people have more difficulty in physical functions, personal care, and household care than do nonarthritis persons.\n The excess disability is greatest for physical functions (walking, reaching, stooping, etc.).\n Disabled arthritis people have especially high degrees of difficulty in physical activities that require endurance and strength.\n (2) Various models are tested for walking, grasping, shopping, and light housework to show how comorbidity propels disability for arthritis people and to show arthritis' own contribution to disability in the presence of other chronic conditions.\n Difficulties escalate for arthritis people when they have other concurrent conditions.\n These models affirm that arthritis has a pronounced effect on physical dysfunctions, but these are not readily translated into personal and household care problems.\n Apparently, arthritis people often make successful accommodations so their roles and daily activities are not seriously affected by the disease.",
