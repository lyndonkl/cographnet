  "text": "The role of pain in the last year of life of older persons.\n A random sample of 200 decreased older community residents was studied with a focus on the role of pain in the last year of life.\n Interviews with a surviving close person elicited retrospective reports.\n Pain increased over the final year; one month before death 66% felt pain frequently or all of the time, substantially higher than a matched comparison group of living persons (24%).\n For both groups across the year, pain was associated with most measures of behavioral competence, perceived quality of life, and psychological well-being.\n Hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that background and health variables explained 28% to 32% of the variance of pain over the year.\n Controlling for background variables and health, pain contributed significantly to lowered happiness and to depression, but had no independent impact on hope and interest in the world.\n After controlling for physical health, the older old were judged to have less pain than the younger old.",
