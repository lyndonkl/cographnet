  "text": "The Gillies method for fractured zygomas: an analysis of 105 cases.\n This prospective study analyzed 105 cases treated using the Gillies temporal approach for fractures of the zygoma.\n In 97 cases (92%) this was sufficient.\n Only eight cases required open reduction.\n It is suggested that the Gillies method be used more frequently, because it is associated with minimal morbidity and a short duration of general anesthesia.",
