  "text": "The National Cholesterol Education Program: guidelines, status, and issues.\n The 1987 report of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) was concerned with who should be treated for high blood cholesterol levels and how they should be treated.\n Total cholesterol levels were classified for identification of cases.\n Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were classified for decisions about treatment.\n The ATP guidelines emphasize diet as the primary approach to treating patients with high blood cholesterol levels.\n The recommendations of the report are being widely publicized through physician and patient educational programs and the mass media.\n The report of the Population Panel of the NCEP provides recommendations and guidelines for the public health approach to the problem of high cholesterol levels.\n When the recommendations of both reports are fully implemented, it is expected that substantial reductions in the incidence of coronary heart disease will be achieved.",
