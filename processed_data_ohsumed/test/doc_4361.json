  "text": "Myeloma of the head of the pancreas. A case report.\n A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, IgA-kappa, in 1975.\n Thirteen years later he presented with obstructive jaundice.\n Computed tomography (CT) showed a 6-cm mass in the head of the pancreas.\n Needle aspiration showed myeloma.\n The jaundice resolved after treatment with radiotherapy.\n Extraosseous involvement by myeloma is frequently found at autopsy but obstructive jaundice from myeloma of the head of the pancreas is quite rare.\n This atypical complication of myeloma may be related to the patient's long survival.",
