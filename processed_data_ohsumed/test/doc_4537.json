  "text": "Vertical partial laryngectomy on demand.\n The author proposes the term 'vertical partial laryngectomy on demand' for all modifications of vertical laryngectomies (frontal, frontolateral, vertical and hemilaryngectomy).\n This term includes two conditions: the first is complete oncological removal of the tumour (proven by histological examination and with the use of magnification or the operating microscope during the operation); secondly, reconstruction of the laryngeal defect by various procedures.\n The author uses the sternohyoid fascia in vertical and frontolateral partial laryngectomies.\n From 120 operated cases, a five-year survival rate of 81 per cent was achieved.\n The fascia showed resistance to post-operative complications and irradiation.",
