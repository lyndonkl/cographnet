  "text": "A comparison of two temporary restorations: light-cured resin versus a self-polymerizing temporary restoration.\n Temporary restorative materials are an important component of endodontic therapy.\n They must both adequately seal the access preparation between visits and protect the obturated canal(s) from microleakage until a permanent restoration can be placed.\n The efficacy of Cavit and T.E.R.M.\n (a new light-cured composite product) was compared with the use of a carbon black coronal microleakage protocol.\n The teeth examined had previously received coronal restorations.\n After the teeth were accessed, restored with Cavit or T.E.R.M., and exposed to the dye, they were cleared.\n Three-dimensional assessment then revealed that Cavit more consistently provided an effective seal.\n In addition, a great deal of microleakage was observed around the permanent restoration-tooth interface.\n This indicates that perhaps leaking permanent restorations should be removed in their entirety before initiation of endodontic treatment.",
