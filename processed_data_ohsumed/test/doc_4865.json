  "text": "Increasing the yield of ventricular tachycardia induction: a prospective, randomized comparative study of the standard ventricular stimulation protocol to a short-to-long protocol and a new two-site protocol.\n Programmed ventricular stimulation with a standard protocol that used up to three extrastimuli was compared prospectively with a short-to-long protocol and a two-site protocol in 77 consecutive patients undergoing electrophysiologic study in an attempt to increase the yield of ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction.\n The short-to-long protocol uses a train of eight stimuli at a short cycle length and up to two extrastimuli.\n The two-site protocol is similar to the standard protocol but delivers the last extrastimulus via a second spatially separated right ventricular catheter.\n Patients were divided into two groups based on indications for study: group 1 included 45 patients with syncope, nonsustained VT, or both, and group 2 included 32 patients with a history of sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or both.\n The yield of VT induction with the short-to-long protocol was less than that with the standard protocol.\n In none of the patients in group 1 in whom the standard protocol results were negative did the short-to-long protocol produce sustained VT.\n Only two patients, both in group 2, had sustained arrhythmias induced by the short-to-long protocol when the standard protocol results were negative: one had sustained VT induced and one with long QT syndrome had ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with the short-to-long protocol.\n However, the short-to-long protocol failed to induce sustained VT in seven patients in whom the standard protocol produced sustained VT.\n All seven of these patients required three extrastimuli with the standard protocol for induction of VT.",
