  "text": "Gastroesophageal reflux and respiratory symptoms: is there an association? Proposed mechanisms and treatment.\n Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a dysfunction of the distal esophagus causing movement of stomach contents into the esophagus.\n Patients may develop heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia, and hemorrhage.\n Respiratory symptoms occur in 10-60 percent of patients with GER or hiatal hernia.\n Although there is evidence associating pulmonary symptoms and GER, causality has not been proven.\n The appropriate use of antireflux therapy or surgery to treat GER may consequently alleviate respiratory symptoms.",
