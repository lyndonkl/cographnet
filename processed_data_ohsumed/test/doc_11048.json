  "text": "Ten years' experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\n Up to January 1989, 171 patients were trained at our center on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 17 on continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD).\n Over 10 years, we have gained 5,068 patient-months experience.\n Patient survival was 60% and 31% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.\n In contrast, diabetics had a survival of 32% at 5 years.\n Major complications included 499 new episodes of peritonitis, 304 exit-site infections, 22 hernias, five bowel perforations, one hydrothorax, and three episodes of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis.\n Our technique survival has been 62% and 40% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.\n We believe that CAPD is a viable dialysis technique for long-term treatment of chronic renal failure and it should be offered as an option to intermittent hemodialysis.",
