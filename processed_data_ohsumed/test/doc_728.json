  "text": "Colonic polyamine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity as markers for adenomas.\n Polyamine content (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) or ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was measured in normal-appearing colonic mucosa from patients undergoing colonoscopy.\n Comparisons were made between those with and those without adenomatous polyps.\n Colonic mucosal polyamine content was measured in 44 persons.\n Mean putrescine content was 1.25 +/- 0.26 (SE) nmol/mg protein in 22 patients with adenomatous polyps compared with 0.53 +/- 0.12 nmol/mg protein in patients without polyps (P less than 0.02).\n Tissue content of spermidine and spermine did not differ between these two groups.\n Ornithine decarboxylase activity was measured in tissue from 45 patients.\n Mean ODC activity was 2.84 +/- 0.73 pmol/hr/mg protein in 23 persons with adenomatous polyps compared with 1.15 +/- 0.18 pmol/hr/mg protein in persons without polyps (P less than 0.05).\n Mucosal putrescine and ODC activity are elevated in patients with adenomatous polyps compared with patients without polyps.\n These biochemical markers may prove helpful in improving surveillance methods for colorectal cancer and premalignant adenomatous polyps.",
