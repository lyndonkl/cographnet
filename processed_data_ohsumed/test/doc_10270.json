  "text": "Connective tissue disease in southeast Georgia. A community based study of immunogenetic markers and autoantibodies.\n HLA antigens, C4 allotypes and T cell antigen receptor (TcR)beta DNA polymorphisms were determined in a community based study of connective tissue diseases (CTD).\n HLA-B8, DR3 and C4A null phenotypes occurred frequently in Caucasian patients with CTD, especially those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but were also more commonly found among healthy white controls of this southeast Georgia community.\n TcR beta gene polymorphisms also showed differential segregation patterns between patients with SLE and scleroderma.\n High frequencies of ANA and anti-ssDNA antibodies occurred among apparently healthy family members and local controls.\n Genetic factors predisposing to CTD in a community setting appear to be similar to those reported from referral centers.",
