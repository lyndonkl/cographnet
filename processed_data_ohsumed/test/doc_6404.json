  "text": "Short-term radiotherapy as palliative treatment in patients with transitional cell bladder cancer.\n We report the results and complications of treatment with palliative, short-term radiotherapy in 162 elderly or disabled patients.\n Improvement in tumour-associated symptoms was noted in 75 of these patients and 72 survived for more than a year.\n Those who responded to radiotherapy had a 5-year cancer-free survival rate of 58% compared with 4% in patients who did not respond to treatment.\n Survival was also affected by stage and indications for radiotherapy.\n In 85 patients without severe symptoms, where the tumour was judged curable but the patient was unsuitable for a full course of radiotherapy, the 5-year cancer-free survival rate was 21%, which is in accordance with what can be achieved with full-course radiotherapy; 42% had various minor acute side effects.\n The 5-year late complication rate was 7%.",
