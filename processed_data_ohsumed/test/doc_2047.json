  "text": "Effect of aortic sclerosis on bone mineral measurements by dual-photon absorptiometry.\n Measurements of the bone mineral content (BMC) of lumbar spine by dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) are performed mainly in the anteroposterior (AP) projection.\n Due to superimposition of the abdominal aorta, the BMC measured for patients with aortic calcification usually is too high.\n To determine the influence of aortic calcifications, DPA scans were performed in the AP-projection on 100 dissected abdominal aortae with different degrees of atherosclerosis placed on a human lumbar spine cast in lucite.\n The measured values were compared with those obtained in the same projection without the aortae.\n The average increase of the BMC values relative to the mean for the vertebrae L2 to L4 for aortae with severe complicated lesions, i.e., those containing larger amounts of calcium, was 0.03 g/cm2, with a maximum deviation of 0.09 g/cm2.\n Aortae with fatty streaks or fibrous plaques did not cause significant increases of the BMC.\n The mean deviation for aortae with mild complicated lesions, i.e., those containing smaller amounts of calcium, was within the range of instrument precision.",
