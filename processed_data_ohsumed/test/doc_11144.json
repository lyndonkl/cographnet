  "text": "Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification.\n The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis.\n This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not.\n From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors.\n Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively.\n Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias.\n In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.\n Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias.\n Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing).\n In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found.\n The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential.\n Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level.\n In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms.",
