  "text": "A topographical relationship between Helicobacter pylori and gastritis: quantitative assessment of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa.\n A topographical relationship between the number of Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa and the histological severity of gastritis was studied in 902 pairs of biopsy specimens taken from 314 patients.\n A pair of biopsies were taken from the antrum, the lesser curvature of the middle body, and the greater curvature of the upper body of the stomach.\n The quantitative assessment of H.\n pylori was made based on smear, culture, and tissue section.\n The histological severity of gastritis was assessed as to the degrees of mononuclear cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration.\n A positive correlation was confirmed between the number of H.\n pylori and the severity of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration.\n The degrees of inflammatory cells infiltration in the specimens with H.\n pylori colonization were significantly lower in the upper body than in the antrum.",
