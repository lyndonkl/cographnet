  "text": "Nosocomial pneumonia in adult patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation: a 9-year study.\n Two hundred seventy-five consecutive patients treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) during a 9-year interval were analyzed for the incidence and etiology of nosocomial pneumonia.\n Cases included adults who acquired pneumonia during the first hospitalization period within 100 days of the transplant.\n Fifty-five (20%) of the 275 patients developed nosocomial pneumonia, and the crude mortality during the hospitalization period was 74.5%.\n An etiology was established in 67.3% (37 of 55) of episodes.\n Thirty-six percent (20 of 55) of the cases were caused by Aspergillus species, either as the sole agent (15 patients) or in association with others.\n The crude mortality for patients with Aspergillus pneumonia was 95%.\n Elimination of 90% of Aspergillus cases in our unit would have the effect of reducing the overall attack rate of nosocomial pneumonia to 13.4% and the associated crude mortality to 43.4%.",
