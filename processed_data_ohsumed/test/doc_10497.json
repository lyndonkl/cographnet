  "text": "Civilian gunshot wounds to the head: a prospective study.\n Previous retrospective studies of cranial gunshot wounds have failed to determine whether aggressive field resuscitation, triage to a neurosurgical center, and early surgical intervention can improve the assumed poor outcome of these severely injured patients.\n Therefore, we studied 100 consecutive patients prospectively to establish a systematic approach to treatment.\n If the patient retained two or more neurological signs after aggressive field resuscitation/intubation, a computed tomographic scan was performed.\n Rapid surgical debridement was done unless the patient deteriorated to clinical brain death.\n The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score after resuscitation was 3 to 5 in 58 patients, 6 to 8 in 8 patients, 9 to 12 in 12 patients, and 13 to 15 in 22 patients.\n Seventy-six computed tomographic scans and 43 craniotomies were performed.\n The Glasgow Outcome Scale scores showed that 60 patients died, 2 were vegetative, 6 were severely disabled, 20 were moderately disabled, and 13 had good outcomes.\n There were 10 postoperative deaths.\n No patient with a GCS score of 3 to 5 had a satisfactory outcome; however, outcome progressively improved as the GCS score increased.\n We conclude that all cranial gunshot patients should initially receive aggressive resuscitation.\n Patients with stable vital signs should be examined by computed tomographic scan.\n If the patient's GCS score after resuscitation is 3 to 5 and no operable hematomas are present, then no further therapy should be offered.\n All patients with a GCS score greater than 5 should receive aggressive surgical therapy.",
