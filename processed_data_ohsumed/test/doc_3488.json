  "text": "Stripping the fetal membranes at term. Is the procedure safe and efficacious?\n A prospective, randomized investigation was undertaken in a low-risk group of pregnant women at term (38-42 weeks' gestation) to determine if stripping the fetal membranes would safely result in earlier delivery.\n Ninety-nine patients entered the study; 51 underwent stripping of the membranes, and 48 controls did not.\n Fifty-nine percent of the patients in the stripped group delivered within one week as compared to 21% in the nonstripped group (P less than .0003).\n Two pregnancies in the stripped group advanced beyond 42 weeks' gestation as compared to six pregnancies in the control group (P = .12).\n A single gravida in the control group developed chorioamnionitis during labor.\n There were no other infections or other complications.\n Stripping the membranes was associated with earlier delivery and was not associated with any complications.",
