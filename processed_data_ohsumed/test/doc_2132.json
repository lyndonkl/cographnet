  "text": "Elective resection of 332 abdominal aortic aneurysms in a southern West Virginia community during a recent five-year period.\n This study analyzed 33 variables that might potentially affect outcome in a series of 332 consecutive elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in a southern West Virginia community.\n One of the interesting features of this series was that the repairs were done by 22 surgeons with varying degrees of experience.\n The mortality and complication rates were compared for various potential risk factors by both univariant methods (chi 2, Fisher's exact, and Student t tests) and multivariant methods of analysis.\n Our early mortality (2.1%) and postoperative complication rates were consistent with those of other series.\n With multiple linear regression models, five factors were selected as significant independent risk factors associated with an increasing number of postoperative complications: the number of blood transfusions (p less than 0.0001), left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.0001), the presence of greater than 50% renal artery stenosis (p = 0.0012), the lesser experience of the surgeon (p = 0.0203), and the history of prior cardiac catheterization (p = 0.0245).\n The only factor statistically correlated with mortality rate was an increased number of postoperative complications (p less than 0.0001).\n Neither postoperative complications nor mortality rate was found to be significant and independently influenced by other demographic, clinical, or operative factors.\n It is tempting to speculate that surgeons with less experience might be well served to refer patients with significant renal artery stenosis and coronary artery disease.\n Our mortality and complication rates were not increased by performing preoperative angiography and therefore prudent surgeons may find this helpful in selecting patients for safer repair.",
