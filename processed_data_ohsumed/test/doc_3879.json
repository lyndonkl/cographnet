  "text": "Surgical complications with the cochlear multiple-channel intracochlear implant: experience at Hannover and Melbourne.\n The surgical complications for the first 153 multiple-channel cochlear implant operations carried out at the Medizinische Hochschule in Hannover and the first 100 operations at the University of Melbourne Clinic, The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, are presented.\n In the Hannover experience the major complications were wound breakdown, wound infection, electrode tie erosion through the external auditory canal, electrode slippage, a persistent increase in tinnitus, and facial nerve stimulation.\n The incidence of wound breakdown requiring removal of the package was 0.6% in Hannover and 1.0% in Melbourne.\n The complications for the operation at both clinics were at acceptable levels.\n It was considered that wound breakdown requiring implant removal could be kept to a minimum by making a generous incision and suturing the flap without tension.",
