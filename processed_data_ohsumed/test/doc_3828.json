  "text": "Surgical management of nonparasitic cystic liver disease.\n We report clinical features, surgical management, recurrences, and follow-up study of 12 patients with simple hepatic cyst, 11 patients with polycystic liver disease, and 19 patients with cystadenoma who were surgically treated over a 25-year period.\n The median age of patients was 48 years, and 37 women and 5 men were in the series.\n The most common presenting symptom and physical finding were chronic abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant.\n The most commonly associated disease was polycystic kidney disease, which was an associated finding in 5 of the 11 patients with polycystic liver disease (45%).\n The most valuable diagnostic studies in all groups were computed tomography and ultrasonography.\n The location of the disease was bilobar in patients with polycystic liver disease, with a right lobe predominance in 18% of patients.\n The right lobe was also predominant in 83% of patients with simple hepatic cyst and 58% of patients with cystadenoma.\n Of all solitary cystic lesions in the left lobe, 75% of them were cystadenomas.\n Of the 66 surgical procedures performed, aspiration was associated with a failure rate of 100%; partial excision, a failure rate of 61%; and total excision and liver resection, a failure rate of 0%.\n Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in three patients and was associated with two early deaths.\n Partial excision relieved symptoms in three patients (43%) with polycystic liver disease.\n Total excision, enucleation, or liver resection with cyst(s) is the treatment of choice for non-parasitic cystic lesions of the liver.",
