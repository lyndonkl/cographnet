  "text": "Life table analysis of fecundity in intravenously gonadotropin-releasing hormone-treated patients with normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea.\n The success of pulsatile intravenous (IV) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) treatment in patients with normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea was studied retrospectively using life table analysis.\n Two hundred forty-four ovulatory cycles in 48 normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic patients were evaluated.\n The cumulative conception rate after 12 cycles was 93%, with a mean conception rate of 22.5% per cycle.\n Comparing cycles 1 to 6 with cycles 7 to 12, no significant difference in conception rate was observed.\n Subdivisions were made relative to the presence of additional infertility factors, history of weight loss, actual weight, estrogenic status, and primary versus secondary amenorrhea.\n The life table curves of patients either with or without other infertility factors were significantly different.\n No statistically significant differences were found in the other subdivisions.\n It is concluded that IV GnRH therapy is highly successful in patients with normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea, especially if no other infertility factors are present.",
