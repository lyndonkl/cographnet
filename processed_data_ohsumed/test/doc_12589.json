  "text": "The repair of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n Current techniques of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair allow most retinal detachments to be repaired successfully.\n The success of repair depends on a careful preoperative examination and choice of an appropriate surgical procedure.\n The surgical procedure must be tailored to the individual eye based on a detailed preoperative examination of the retina and vitreous.\n Postoperative complications are not infrequent compared to many other ophthalmic surgical procedures such as cataract extraction and strabismus repair.\n The surgeon must observe the eye carefully in the postoperative period to monitor and treat any complications as they arise.\n Improvements in surgical techniques coupled with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment continue to improve the anatomic and functional success of retinal detachment repair.",
