  "text": "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy for calculi in horseshoe kidneys.\n Between 1983 and 1988, 15 patients (18 kidneys) underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy at this unit for calculi in horseshoe kidneys.\n A standard 1-stage percutaneous access technique with minor modifications was used.\n In situ disintegration with ultrasound or electrohydraulic lithotripsy was necessary in 15 moieties (83.3%) and nephrostomy drainage was required in 12 (66.7%).\n Percutaneous access was not a problem and there were minimal perioperative problems.\n Blood transfusion was required postoperatively in 2 patients.\n A total of 14 kidneys (77.8%) were rendered free of stone with percutaneous nephrolithotomy alone and 2 kidneys were left with asymptomatic stone fragments of 2 mm.\n or less.\n Another 2 kidneys became free of stone after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, thus giving an over-all stone clearance rate of 88.8%.\n We conclude that percutaneous nephrolithotomy is an acceptable treatment for stones in horseshoe kidneys and it is the treatment of choice for patients in whom imaging is difficult or impossible.",
