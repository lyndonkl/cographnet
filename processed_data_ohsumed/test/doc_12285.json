  "text": "Cyclosporin A in atopic dermatitis: therapeutic response is dissociated from effects on allergic reactions.\n Fourteen patients with severe chronic atopic dermatitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun; 5 mg/kg/day) for 7-16 weeks.\n All showed a marked clinical improvement and half could omit topical corticosteroid treatment during therapy.\n Adverse effects were minor, but two patients relapsed despite continued treatment.\n In the others, the disease recurred soon after stopping CyA.\n Serum IgE levels and prick-test responses were unchanged by CyA.\n Immediate and late-phase cutaneous responses to intradermal house dust mite antigen (HDM) were significantly increased during treatment; but a delayed response, present at 24 and 48 h, was unaffected.\n Four of six patients challenged with HDM patch tests to tape-stripped skin during treatment showed eczematous reactions at 48 h.\n Thus, cyclosporin A has a powerful therapeutic effect in atopic dermatitis but does not reduce allergic responses to inhalant antigens.",
