  "text": "Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal colonization and infection in a long-term care facility \n OBJECTIVE: To determine the natural history of colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among patients in a long-term care facility.\n We specifically sought to determine if MRSA colonization was predictive of subsequent infection.\n DESIGN: Cohort study.\n SETTING: Long-term Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n PATIENTS: A total of 197 patients residing on two units were followed with regular surveillance cultures of the anterior nares.\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The development of staphylococcal infection.\n RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were persistent carriers of MRSA and 44 were persistent carriers of methicillin-susceptible strains (MSSA).\n Twenty-five percent of MRSA carriers had an episode of staphylococcal infection compared with 4% of MSSA carriers and 4.5% of non-carriers (P less than 0.01; relative risk 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.4).\n The rate of development of infection among MRSA carriers was 15% for every 100 days of carriage.\n Using logistic regression analysis, persistent MRSA carriage was the most significant predictor of infection (P less than 0.001; odds ratio, 3.7).\n Seventy-three percent of all MRSA infections occurred among MRSA carriers.\n Isolates of MRSA from 7 patients were typed.\n Colonizing and infecting strains had the same phage type in all 7 patients and the same pattern of plasmid EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragments in 5 patients.\n CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of the anterior nares by MRSA predicts the development of staphylococcal infection in long-term care patients; most infections arise from endogenously carried strains.\n Colonization by MRSA indicates a significantly greater risk for infection than does colonization by MSSA.\n The results offer a theoretic rationale for reduction in MRSA infections by interventions aimed at eliminating the carrier state.",
