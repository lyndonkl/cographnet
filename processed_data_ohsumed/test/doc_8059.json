  "text": "Correlation of ultrasound guided and digitally directed transrectal biopsies of palpable prostatic abnormalities.\n The authors evaluated 51 patients with palpable prostatic abnormalities detected during digital rectal examination.\n These findings consisted of a nodule or an area of induration.\n Each palpable abnormality was confined to 1 prostatic lobe and there was no suggestion of extracapsular extension of neoplasm or systemic metastatic disease.\n All patients underwent 7.0 MHz.\n sagittal ultrasound guided transrectal biopsy followed by digitally directed transrectal biopsy.\n Biopsies were obtained only from the area of interest.\n The procedure was performed in the outpatient clinic without use of sedation or anesthesia.\n Digitally directed biopsies were positive for adenocarcinoma in 9 lesions.\n Ultrasound guided biopsies detected adenocarcinoma in 23 lesions, including all those detected by the blind digitally directed technique.\n This study demonstrates greater diagnostic accuracy using 7.0 MHz.\n ultrasound guided techniques and its routine use is warranted in the evaluation of palpable prostatic abnormalities.",
