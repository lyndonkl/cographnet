  "text": "Delayed death from aortic root trauma.\n A 40-year-old man suffered blunt chest trauma, had a myocardial infarct 58 days later, and died unexpectedly 19 days after that.\n Autopsy showed partial avulsion of a small branch of the right coronary artery with thrombus extending into the right coronary sinus of Valsalva occluding the right coronary artery and causing a myocardial infarct.\n Death was caused by a thromboembolus arising from the aortic root thrombus and occluding the left main coronary artery.\n The case is unusual in that the major consequences of the aortic root trauma were delayed, and death resulted from occlusion of both coronary arteries.",
