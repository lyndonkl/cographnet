  "text": "That old hip. The osteoporosis process.\n Osteoporosis is a major health concern that will contribute to an increasing number of hip fractures as the population ages.\n Researchers are continuing to evaluate the role that decreased level of estrogen at menopause and prolonged calcium insufficiency play in the development of osteoporosis.\n In addition, many health care recommendations are aimed at maximizing peak bone mass and preventing bone loss to decrease the chance of hip fracture.\n New studies are evaluating the efficacy of experimental medications to rebuild bone mass once osteoporosis has developed.\n Current prevention guidelines include adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and moderate exercise.\n At menopause, estrogen replacement therapy is recommended for those younger than 50 years or considered at high risk for developing osteoporosis.\n All people are encouraged to decrease the risk of fracture by evaluating their home environment for hazards that might contribute to falls.\n Nursing needs to develop new strategies and interventions to educate the public about osteoporosis, improve the quality of life for persons with osteoporosis, and decrease the osteoporotic hip fracture mortality rate.\n Will it rise to the challenge?.",
