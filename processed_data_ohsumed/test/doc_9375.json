  "text": "Stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using a multimodal image analysis system. Technical note.\n A methodology has been developed for stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using an image-analysis system that simultaneously displays different structural and functional images of the brain.\n The validity and accuracy of this system were established with phantom studies.\n Surgical planning and electrode implantation are guided by stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and position emission tomography.\n This methodology provides the spatiotemporal relationship of cerebral structure and function necessary to identify seizure onset and propagation in human limbic system epilepsy.",
