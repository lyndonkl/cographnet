  "text": "Nonoperative management of blunt liver injuries in adults: the need for continued surveillance.\n Computed tomography (CT) scanning after blunt abdominal trauma has allowed nonoperative management of selected patients with liver injuries.\n This report describes 52 adult patients with liver injuries who were treated without immediate surgery.\n Thirty-four of these hepatic injuries were relatively minor (Grade I-II), and 18 were considered major (Grade III-V).\n Free intraperitoneal blood in small to large amounts was evident on CT in 37 patients.\n There were no deaths in this series, no major complications, no known missed intra-abdominal injuries, and no delayed hemorrhage.\n While most liver injuries appear to heal rapidly by serial CT scans, a small percentage of these patients have residual liver defects persisting for several months and may be at risk for future complications.",
