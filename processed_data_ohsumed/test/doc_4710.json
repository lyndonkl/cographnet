  "text": "Smooth muscle cell proliferation and restenosis after stand alone coronary excimer laser angioplasty \n It has been shown that coronary excimer laser angioplasty can remove atherosclerotic intracoronary tissue.\n Stand alone coronary excimer laser angioplasty was successfully performed in a 53 year old white man with 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and exertional angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III).\n The lesion was reduced to a 30% residual stenosis with use of a 1.2 mm and subsequently a 1.8 mm diameter laser catheter.\n Early follow-up angiography 24 h later revealed persistent patency and unchanged lesion diameter of the target vessel.\n The patient was free of symptoms during the 2 month follow-up period, but died suddenly while playing in a tennis tournament 63 days after the procedure.\n Postmortem histologic examination revealed 80% restenosis at the lesion site without plaque disruption or thrombosis.\n Specific staining of the histologic specimen for smooth muscle cells using alpha-actin revealed significant smooth muscle cell proliferation at the site of coronary excimer laser angioplasty.\n However, most of the vessel narrowing appeared to be due to underlying fibrotic plaque as a result of insufficient tissue ablation.\n This was probably related to the size of the currently available catheters, which are too small to create a large channel.",
