  "text": "Ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n The pedigrees were constructed of 43 patients (probands) who underwent resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n Seven probands (16.2%) had a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) known to have had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (multiplex family).\n To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm, ultrasound screening of first-degree relatives over age 40 years was undertaken.\n Of 202 eligible relatives, 103 (51.0%) were screened.\n An occult abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm or an infrarenal/suprarenal aortic diameter ratio of greater than 1.5.\n An incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm was defined as a clear focal bulge of the infrarenal aorta, which was less than 3.0 cm in greatest diameter.\n Four of 103 relatives (3.9%) were found to have an occult abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 57M, 60M, 62F, 65M), and three (2.9%) were found with an incipient abdominal aortic aneurysm (age/sex: 56M, 60M, 67F).\n These smaller abdominal aortic aneurysms were in patients younger than the operated probands (average age men, 67 years; women, 69 years).\n Six of seven individuals were in families previously considered simplex, increasing the actual multiplex family frequency from 16.2% to 27.9%.\n All seven new abdominal aortic aneurysms were found in the 49 siblings age 55 years or older.\n There were no abdominal aortic aneurysms found in the 39 relatives under age 55 years, in 14 children ages 50 to 59 years or in one parent.\n Therefore of the siblings age 55 years or older, 5/20 men (25.0%) and 2/29 women (6.9%) were found to have a previously undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysm.",
