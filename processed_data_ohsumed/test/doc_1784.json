  "text": "Central odontogenic fibroma: clinicopathologic features of 19 cases and review of the literature.\n The odontogenic fibroma is a benign neoplasm infrequently reported in the literature (20 cases).\n Nineteen additional examples are reported.\n This lesion occurs most frequently in the maxilla anterior to the molars and displays a striking female predilection.\n On occasion, it may be associated with an unerupted mandibular third molar.\n Histomorphologically, it is not encapsulated.\n A spectrum of fibrous connective tissue stroma is present: from myxoid to densely hyalinized and from relatively acellular to cellular.\n Calcification may or may not be present.\n It is distinguished by the presence of sparse cords and islands of inactive odontogenic epithelium.\n Enucleation or surgical curettage is appropriate therapy and recurrence is low.\n As there appears to be no correlation of histologic pattern with clinical behavior, it seems unnecessary to try to separate the tumor into two variants.",
