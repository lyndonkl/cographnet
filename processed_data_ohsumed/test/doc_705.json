  "text": "Pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy: an overview.\n Pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) was reintroduced 12 years ago.\n Since that time, over 400 patients have undergone PPPD with approximately 41 per cent having chronic pancreatitis and 54 per cent having pancreatic and other periampullary malignancies.\n Reported 5-year survivals in this latter group have been comparable to those achieved by the classic Whipple procedure.\n The postoperative mortality rate in 339 reported patients has been 3.8 per cent.\n Postoperative morbidity, including delayed gastric emptying, has been similar to that of the classic Whipple operation.\n However, PPPD has been associated with fewer late problems with dumping, diarrhoea, delayed gastric emptying (8.6 per cent), and marginal ulceration (3.6 per cent).\n Moreover, most patients undergoing PPPD have been able to return to their preoperative and preillness weight.\n The additional advantage of decreased operative time makes PPPD an attractive alternative to the classic pancreatoduodenectomy.",
