  "text": "A new dynamic lumbrical simulating splint for claw hand deformity.\n The claw hand deformity, resulting from low ulnar or combined low ulnar and median nerve palsy, is an incapacitating situation.\n The splint described herein reverses the clawing by substituting for the lumbricals and interossei.\n If started early, it not only prevents the permanent stiffness of fingers in the claw position, but also effectively restores function without hampering day to day work because it is a surface splint.",
