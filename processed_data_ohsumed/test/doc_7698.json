  "text": "Photochemotherapy alone or combined with interferon alpha-2a in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n Eighty-two patients with either mycosis fungoides (MF) or parapsoriasis en plaques were treated with psoralens ultraviolet A light (PUVA).\n Clinical and histologic parameters were followed for a period from 6 months to 10 years.\n Complete clinical clearing of lesions was observed in 51 patients (62%) and most of them were in limited-plaque MF group or parapsoriasis en plaque.\n The mean total dose of PUVA for complete clearing was less for early MF.\n Thirty-one patients (38%) relapsed and responded to additional PUVA.\n Patients in early stages of the disease remained clear for up to 68 months after the first course of PUVA.\n Post-treatment skin biopsies with early MF showed histologic clearing.\n A new combination therapy for MF is presented in 15 patients.\n Recombinant interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A), administered intramuscularly combined with PUVA were tested in a phase I trial.\n Interferon doses were from 6-30 million units three times weekly.\n Disease stages ranged from I-B to IV-B.\n Complete responses were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses seen in 2 of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%.\n The median duration of response exceeded 23 months (range, 3 to 25 months).\n All responding patients have been maintained on therapy.\n The dose-limiting toxicities were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%).\n Interferon plus PUVA appear to be highly effective regimens for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.",
