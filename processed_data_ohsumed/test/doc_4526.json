  "text": "Nasal reconstruction with articulated irradiated rib cartilage.\n Nasal structural reconstruction is a formidable task in cases where there is loss of support to both the nasal dorsum and tip.\n A multitude of surgical approaches and materials have been used for the correction of the saddle-nose deformity with varying degrees of success.\n Articulated irradiated rib cartilage inserted through an external rhinoplasty approach was used to reconstruct nasal deformities in 18 patients over a 6-year period.\n Simultaneous use of a midline forehead flap to reconstruct the overlying soft tissue was required in four cases.\n Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 2.8 years).\n Results were rewarding in most cases with marked improvement in nasal support and airway.\n Revision and/or replacement secondary to trauma or warping of the graft was required in four cases.\n None of the patients exhibited infection, extrusion, or noticeable resorption.\n A description of the surgical technique, review of all the cases, and recommendation for continued use of this graft material are discussed.",
