  "text": "Dialysis, transplantation, and pregnancy.\n Women on regular dialysis are usually infertile, but contraception should not be neglected.\n Pregnancy is invariably complicated and poses excessive risks, with an uncertain and low chance of success.\n Even when therapeutic abortion is excluded, the live birth outcome at best is 19%.\n Renal transplantation usually reverses abnormal reproductive function and comprehensive pre-pregnancy counseling is essential, with discussion of all implications, including the harsh realities of long-term maternal survival.\n In this survey of 2,309 pregnancies in 1,594 women, therapeutic abortion was undertaken in 27% of conceptions and the spontaneous abortion rate was 13%.\n Of the conceptions that continued beyond the first trimester, 92% ended successfully.\n In most, renal function was augmented in pregnancy, with transient deterioration in late pregnancy (with or without proteinuria).\n Permanent renal impairment occurred in 15% of pregnancies.\n There was a 30% chance of developing hypertension, preeclampsia or both.\n Preterm delivery occurred in 50%, and intrauterine growth retardation in 25% of pregnancies.\n Despite its pelvic location, the transplanted kidney rarely produced dystocia and was not injured during vaginal delivery.\n Cesarean section should be reserved for obstetric reasons only.\n Neonatal complications include respiratory distress syndrome, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, adrenocortical insufficiency, and infection.\n No predominant or frequent developmental abnormalities have been described and data on infancy and childhood are encouraging.\n For the future more work is needed to improve pre-pregnancy assessment criteria, to understand the mechanisms of gestational renal dysfunction and proteinuria, to assess the side effects and implications of immunosuppression in pregnancy, and to elucidate the remote effects of pregnancy on both renal prognosis and the offspring.",
