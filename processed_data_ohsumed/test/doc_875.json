  "text": "Chylous ascites due to sarcoidosis.\n A 33-yr-old black female with systemic sarcoidosis developed chylous ascites.\n A CT scan showed extensive mesenteric lymphadenopathy.\n At laparotomy, the mesenteric and para-aortic lymph nodes were enlarged and diffusely matted.\n Histologically, normal lymph node morphology was virtually replaced with noncaseating granulomas.\n Corticosteroids and dietary manipulations were unsuccessful in managing the ascites, and repeated large-volume paracentesis was necessary to provide symptomatic treatment.\n This is the first reported case of chylous ascites caused by sarcoidosis.",
