  "text": "Microcomputer reconstruction for analysis of spinal deformity and lung volume in hypokyphotic scoliosis.\n Current techniques for imaging chest deformity are limited to two-dimensional representations, and clinical testing for lung volume measurements are based on pulmonary function studies that are effort-dependent.\n The authors evaluated spine deformity and lung volume by using a new three-dimensional microcomputer imaging technique.\n Results from preoperative and postoperative chest computed tomograms underwent boundary detection by expert human observers.\n Data were then processed by polygon surface tiling to create three-dimensional color images of the spine and lungs for display.\n This computer technique allowed: 1) visualization of the anatomic relationships from any angle, 2) assessment of spinal deformity in relation to lung volume, and 3) measurement of individual lung volumes.\n Three-dimensional microcomputer imaging is a useful technique in objectively measuring lung volume and assessing postoperative changes.",
