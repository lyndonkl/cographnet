  "text": "Sacral plexus injury after radiotherapy for carcinoma of cervix.\n A 42-year-old woman developed lower extremity weakness and sensory loss 1 year after external and intracavitary radiotherapy for Stage IB carcinoma of cervix.\n She has been followed for 5 years posttreatment, and the neurologic abnormalities have persisted, but no evidence of recurrent carcinoma has been found.\n We believe this to be a rare case of sacral plexus radiculopathy developing as a late complication after radiotherapy.\n Suggestions are made for improving the radiotherapy technique to prevent this complication in future cases.",
