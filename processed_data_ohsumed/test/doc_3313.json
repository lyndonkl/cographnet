  "text": "Effects of long-term verapamil therapy on serum lipids and other metabolic parameters.\n Calcium antagonists have been used successfully in the management of hypertension for more than a decade, but less is known about their long-term metabolic effects.\n To define the impact of one calcium antagonist, verapamil, on serum lipids and other metabolic parameters, we placed 45 hypertensive patients on verapamil monotherapy and followed them for 4 to 8 years.\n After a mean treatment period of 5.3 years, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different from baseline, whereas the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value increased significantly from 1.17 +/- 0.41 mmol/L at the initiation of treatment to 1.39 +/- 0.36 mmol/L at 5.3 years (p less than 0.05).\n Other important biochemical parameters, including serum glucose, potassium and uric acid levels were unaffected by verapamil therapy.\n No serious side effects or adverse cardiovascular events occurred during verapamil therapy, and there were no study dropouts.\n It therefore seems likely that this agent will become increasingly useful in the long-term management of essential hypertension.",
