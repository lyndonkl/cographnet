  "text": "Pharmacokinetics of tiaprofenic acid after oral administration in fasting patients during and between migraine attacks.\n This study examined the pharmacokinetics of 300 mg of tiaprofenic acid, a NSAID belonging to the 2-arylpropionic class, as a single oral dose, in 10 migraine patients during and out of migraine attacks.\n Plasma concentration of tiaprofenic acid was determined by HPLC analysis.\n Drug absorption appeared to be the same during and out of migraine attacks (absorption half life: during attack, 0.249 +/- 0.122 hr; out of attack, 0.249 +/- 0.105 hr; maximum plasma concentration: during attack, 37.8 +/- 9.8 ug/ml; out of attack, 40.1 +/- 13.2 ug/ml).\n The other pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were not affected by headache attacks as well.\n We conclude that tiaprofenic acid absorption and metabolism are not affected by migraine attacks.\n Also, our data suggest that tiaprofenic acid might be useful in the treatment of migraine.",
