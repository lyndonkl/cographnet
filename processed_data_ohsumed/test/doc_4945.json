  "text": "Ventilatory effect of acute pulmonary hypothermia.\n The isolated effect of cooling the pulmonary circulation on ventilation was quantified in nine anesthetized dogs.\n The right pulmonary artery (RPA) was cannulated within the pericardium, and systemic blood was pumped from the left atrium to the RPA between, but not during, periods of cooling.\n Cooled blood boluses were injected into the RPA under conditions in which either bolus temperature (5-35 degrees C) or volume (0-1.5 ml/kg body wt) varied.\n Inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breath duration (TT), and peak integrated activity (PEAK) were determined from diaphragm EMG.\n Results for five postinjection breaths were converted to a percent of the values from five preinjection breaths.\n There was a linear relationship between bolus temperature and TI [r = 0.61, slope (x) = 0.59%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), TE (r = 0.73, x = 1.43%/degrees C, P less than 0.001] as well as TT (r = 0.74, x = 1.10%/degrees C, P less than 0.001), whereas PEAK was unaffected (n = 9).\n When injection temperature was 5 degrees C, an inverse linear relationship existed between bolus volume and TI (r = 0.75, x = -15.2%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) and TE (r = 0.78, x = -23.4%.ml-1.kg-1, P less than 0.001) (n = 4).\n In two dogs tested the effect of bolus injection was minimal at residual volume and progressively increased with lung volume.\n The effect of cold bolus injection was eliminated after right vagotomy in three dogs.\n Results indicate that cooling of some vagal receptor in the lung increases breathing frequency primarily by shortening TE.",
