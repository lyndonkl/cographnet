  "text": "Use of cyproterone acetate in prostate cancer.\n Cyproterone acetate is a progestational antiandrogen with potent antigonadotropic activity that results in rapid suppression of serum testosterone.\n Used as a single agent, cyproterone acetate yields a total androgen blockade.\n It may be combined with low-dose diethylstilbestrol, orchiectomy, or LHRH agonists to improve, in theory, the results of such therapy.\n In clinical testing, cyproterone acetate has proved equivalent to diethylstilbestrol with markedly less toxicity.\n It is useful in conjunction with LHRH agonists, either transiently to block the flare phenomenon, or continuously to block peripheral androgen receptors; the necessity for this latter action has not yet been proved.\n Cyproterone acetate may afford transient objective improvement in patients not responding to other forms of hormone deprivation.\n Experience in this role is limited.\n The drug may be used to suppress the hot flushes associated with orchiectomy or LHRH agonist therapy.\n Cyproterone acetate induces local tumor regression; owing to its reversible effects, it is useful as neoadjuvant or adjuvant androgen withdrawal therapy in patients with lower-stage disease undergoing radical surgery or radiotherapy.\n Adverse effects are mostly those related to hormone withdrawal, namely, impotence, infertility, and lassitude.\n Gynecomastia and breast tenderness occur in less than 18% and cardiovascular complications in approximately 10% of treated men.",
