  "text": "Fructosamine compared with a glucose load as a screening test for gestational diabetes.\n Five hundred seven women were screened for gestational diabetes between 20-36 weeks' gestation.\n All received a 100-g glucose (polycose) load at 28 weeks with measurement of plasma glucose 1 hour later.\n Fructosamine levels were measured at 4-week intervals from 20-36 weeks.\n At 36 weeks, a full 100-g 3-hour glucose tolerance test was performed on all subjects.\n Eighteen women were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes.\n The glucose load had a sensitivity of 81% in detection of gestational diabetes, compared with 50% for fructosamine at 36 weeks.\n Fructosamine is not useful as a screening test for gestational diabetes as currently defined.",
