  "text": "Results of treatment of idiopathic scoliosis with the Charleston bending orthosis.\n The authors present a preliminary retrospective review of the treatment of 32 patients with idiopathic scoliosis with the Charleston bending thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO), a new, low-profile spinal orthosis.\n At the onset of treatment, the patients' mean age was 12.5 years and the mean Risser stage was 0.4.\n Females achieved menarche at an mean of 1.8 months after starting orthotic treatment.\n Single structural curves were treated in all patients.\n At this time, 2 patients have failed treatment, their curves progressing 12 degrees and 8 degrees, respectively.\n An additional 11 patients have successfully completed treatment, having reached skeletal maturity with no more than 5 degrees of curve progression.\n Their mean curve change was a 2.2 degrees decrease.\n The other 19 patients remain under treatment.\n The Charleston bending TLSO is worn only during nighttime sleeping hours.\n It is well tolerated, with excellent patient compliance and low psychological stress, and it may be as successful at curve control as other orthoses.\n Experience with more patients and longer follow-up is needed.",
