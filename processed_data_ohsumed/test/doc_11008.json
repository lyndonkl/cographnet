  "text": "Intraoperative management of severe endobronchial hemorrhage \n Endobronchial hemorrhage due to pulmonary artery perforation by a Swan-Ganz catheter developed during coronary artery bypass grafting while weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.\n After reinstitution of cardio-pulmonary bypass with pulmonary artery venting, bleeding was localized to the right lower lobe bronchus using fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\n A Fogarty embolectomy catheter was inflated in the bronchus to tamponade successfully only the right lower lobe.\n This case illustrates a method of distal bronchial blockade for maximal retention of pulmonary function and avoidance of pulmonary resection.",
