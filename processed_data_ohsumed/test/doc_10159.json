  "text": "Immune sensitization against epidermal antigens in polymorphous light eruption.\n To get further insight into the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption, we studied nine patients with polymorphous light eruption and six healthy persons.\n Two skin biopsy specimens were obtained from each person, one from previously ultraviolet light-irradiated skin and another one from unirradiated skin.\n An epidermal cell suspension, skin homogenate, or both were prepared from each specimen.\n Autologous cultures were made with peripheral blood mononuclear cells combined with irradiated or unirradiated skin homogenate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells combined with irradiated or unirradiated epidermal cell suspension.\n Cell proliferation was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation assay.\n The response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to unirradiated epidermal cells or unirradiated skin homogenate was similar in both patients and controls.\n However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with polymorphous light eruption showed a significantly increased proliferative response to both irradiated epidermal cells and irradiated skin homogenate.\n Our results indicate that ultraviolet light increases the stimulatory capability of polymorphous light eruption epidermal cells in a unidirectional mixed culture with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n This suggests that an immune sensitization against autologous ultraviolet light-modified skin antigens occurs in polymorphous light eruption.",
