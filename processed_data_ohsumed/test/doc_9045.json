  "text": "Familial eating epilepsy.\n Eating-related seizures affecting 20 individuals among 59 siblings belonging to nine families are presented.\n The type of epilepsy was partial in all the affected individuals, and the seizures complex in 15 and simple in 5, secondarily generalized in the majority.\n The onset of epilepsy, in most cases, was in the second decade of life.\n A remarkable degree of intra-family consistency was observed with regard to age at onset, symptomatology of seizures and timing of eating seizures.\n The study demonstrates sibling clustering in a partial epilepsy, implicating for the first time genetic susceptibility in the aetiology of eating epilepsy.",
