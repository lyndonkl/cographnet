  "text": "Resting energy expenditure is increased in stable, malnourished HIV-infected patients.\n Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by reference to body composition in 50 malnourished patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and compared with that of 14 healthy subjects.\n Among HIV patients, 40 had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 10 had AIDS-related complex (ARC).\n All were in stable condition and had a previous history of progressive wasting, ie, a mean body weight loss of 14.2 +/- 8.1 kg over 16.6 mo (range 2-49 ms).\n The mean REE was 14% higher than estimated basal energy expenditure (EBEE), according to the Harris and Benedict formula.\n Thirty-four patients (68%) were classified as hypermetabolic (REE greater than 110% EBEE).\n The best predictable variable for REE was fat-free mass (FFM), as determined by an anthropometric method (r = 0.72; P less than 0.001).\n The mean REE was 12% higher in HIV patients than in the control group FFM (156 +/- 19 vs 124 +/- 17 kJ.kg FFM-1.d-1).\n We concluded that in stable and malnourished HIV patients, the progressive wasting may be partly related to an increase in REE.\n The mechanism of this hypermetabolic state remains to be established.",
