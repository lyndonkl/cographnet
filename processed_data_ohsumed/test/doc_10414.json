  "text": "Suicides by starter's pistols and air guns.\n We report the case of a 25-year-old depressed woman who committed suicide with a starter's pistol loaded with CS tear-gas ammunition.\n The propellant gases of the contact shot entered her chest through the left sixth intercostal space.\n Exsanguination was caused by perforations of the pericardium and apex of the heart.\n Autopsy did not reveal any metallic or other foreign bodies that might have originated from the propellant, the cartridge, or any bulletlike material.\n Her injuries were thus caused by the propellant alone.\n 0.5 mg L-1 of the CS degradation product cyanide was detected in the cardiac blood.\n We also report the case of a 54-year-old man, suffering from depressive psychosis, who committed suicide with an air rifle.\n The lead-pointed Diabolo bullet entered his brain through the right large wing of the sphenoid bone, traversed the right temporal brain pole, damaged the right middle cerebral artery and the right optic tract, and finally lodged in the left central ganglia.\n There was extensive basal subdural hemorrhage and tamponade of all cerebral ventricles.\n Death was attributed to cerebral failure.\n We furthermore list another 26 cases of suicide by rarely used weapons from 1947 to 1989.",
