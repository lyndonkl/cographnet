  "text": "Primary mass closure of midline incisions with a continuous polyglyconate monofilament absorbable suture.\n Mass closure of midline incisions with a running large-bore permanent monofilament polypropylene suture has been used in general surgery and gynecology patients with a reported small incidence of fascial dehiscence.\n Late-occurring wound sinus formation is one problem reported with the use of this permanent suture material.\n Over a 22-month period, 285 patients had midline incisions closed with a continuous, running no.\n 1 polyglyconate monofilament delayed absorbable suture.\n Closely spaced bites (about 1.5 cm apart) were taken and placed 2 cm lateral to the fascial edge.\n Over 60% of the patients had surgery because of gynecologic cancer.\n Other high-risk factors included obesity in 62%, diabetes in 19%, and previous irradiation or chemotherapy in 22%.\n An ovarian cancer staging procedure was done in 16% of the patients.\n Of the remaining patients, almost half had extensive operative procedures that ranged from exenterations to hysterectomies with lymph node dissection.\n Wound complications were noted in nine patients (3.2%).\n Seven had superficial infections, one had an evisceration, and one developed a ventral hernia.\n Wound sinuses did not occur.\n The closure technique is safe and expedient and distributes tension equally over a continuous line.\n It has the additional advantage of eventual absorption of the suture material, thereby avoiding the wound sinus problems occasionally reported with large-bore permanent sutures.",
