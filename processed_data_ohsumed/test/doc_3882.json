  "text": "Electrophysiologic characteristics of manifest and latent retrograde conduction in dogs.\n Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry requires intact retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction.\n The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of various pacing and pharmacologic techniques to uncover VA conduction during apparent unidirectional VA block, and to evaluate the role of several biologic and electrophysiologic factors in concealment of retrograde conduction.\n Forty healthy dogs underwent catheter-electrophysiologic studies of AV and VA conduction.\n Group I (20 animals) had intact VA conduction.\n Group II (six animals) had VA dissociation with ventricular pacing initiated during sinus rhythm, but the presence of VA conduction was confirmed by isoproterenol infusion or by premature ventricular stimulation.\n In group III (14 animals), the above techniques failed to uncover VA conduction.\n Eight of 14 group III animals underwent thoracotomy and crushing or freezing of the sinoatrial (SA) node.\n Ventricular pacing initiated during sinus standstill was associated with 1:1 VA conduction in each experiment.\n VA conduction time and retrograde Wenckebach cycle length, both in the baseline state and during isoproterenol infusion, were significantly longer in the eight animals in group III than in those in group I.\n Age, gender, weight, breed, sinus cycle length, and anterograde AV conduction properties were not significantly different between groups I, II, and III.\n The data suggest that (1) in normal dogs, complete unidirectional VA block probably does not exist; (2) in the presence of anterograde input to the AV node, even sophisticated pacing and pharmacologic maneuvers may fail to uncover the presence of VA conduction; (3) although anterograde input is essential for concealment of VA conduction, the phenomenon is more closely associated with depressed retrograde than with anterograde AV nodal characteristics.",
