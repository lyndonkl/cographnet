  "text": "Human atherosclerotic coronary artery xenografts: a model for investigation of transluminal recanalization.\n A model for testing transluminal recanalization techniques was developed.\n Fragments of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were transplanted into carotid arteries of dogs and evaluated by angiographic, angioscopic, and histologic study within a three-month period.\n An inflammatory response was most intense within the first week.\n By two weeks no inflammation was noted.\n Total occlusion (n = 13) and stenosis (n = 11) of the carotid arteries were achieved without complications.\n The model is easy to produce within a short period and the arterial occlusion resembles human vascular disease.\n This model has been used to evaluate laser recanalization of vascular obstructions.",
