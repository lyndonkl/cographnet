  "text": "Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials in multiple sclerosis: the relation to VEP, SEP and CSF immunoglobulins.\n One hundred patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were analysed retrospectively with respect to investigations of brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), and cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulins (CSF-IG).\n BAEP were abnormal in 42% of those with normal VEP and SEP examinations, and in 38% of patients with normal CSF-IG.\n The chance of obtaining at least one abnormal EP was lower in patients with normal CSF-IG than in patients with abnormal CSF.\n When a \"dispersion ratio\" was included in the criteria for BAEP abnormality, the sensitivity increased compared with conventional BAEP criteria.\n We recommend that BAEP should still be included in the EP test battery for patients with suspected MS.",
