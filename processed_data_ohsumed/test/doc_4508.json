  "text": "Morbidity associated with incompletely erupted third molars in the line of mandibular fractures.\n A retrospective analysis of 105 mandibular fractures associated with incompletely erupted third molars was undertaken.\n It was found that there was no difference in the rates of complication if the teeth were retained or extracted, or if an open or closed reduction was performed.\n The combination of tooth retention with open reduction, however, shows a trend toward being the treatment most prone to postoperative complications.",
