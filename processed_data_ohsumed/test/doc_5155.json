  "text": "CO2-welded venous anastomosis: enhancement of weld strength with heterologous fibrin glue.\n The milliwatt CO2 laser was used to perform end-to-end anastomoses in canine jugular veins.\n There was a high disruption rate (50%) in laser-welded veins (n = 10).\n Fibrin glue (n = 17), formed from human fresh-frozen plasma, enhanced the weld strength decreasing the disruption rate (18%), resulting in an 82% patency which nearly equaled the contralateral sutured vein patency (93%).\n The bursting strength was improved with fibrin glue.\n Transmural necrosis was present initially in all groups but extended for a longer distance in the vessel wall in laser-welded anastomoses.\n Sutured anastomoses exhibited a greater inflammatory response.\n In laser-welded anastomoses endothelial cells were not as confluent as in sutured anastomoses by six weeks.\n Carbon dioxide laser-welded end-to-end vein anastomoses appear to be impractical because they disrupt too easily.\n However, the addition of heterologous fibrin glue to the weld results in a reasonably strong anastomosis with histologic properties that may be beneficial in vein bypass grafts.",
