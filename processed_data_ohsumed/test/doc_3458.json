  "text": "Carcinoma of female urethra. Manitoba experience: 1958-1987.\n Fourteen female patients with primary urethral carcinoma were treated at the Manitoba Cancer Foundation in the last twenty-nine years.\n The relationship of natural history to the stage, location, and therapeutic modality has been reviewed.\n A higher stage and length of urethral involvement affected prognosis negatively, whereas lower stage had a positive prognostic effect and location of tumor had no prognostic influence.\n Two patients with Stage C, who failed to received inguinal node radiotherapy, died of disease recurring in the inguinal area.\n Patients who received inguinal radiation (3 patients Stages B, C, and D1) had no regional recurrence.\n It is suggested that, for all female urethral carcinoma, bilateral ilioinguinal nodes be included in the radiation field.\n For radical treatment, iridium 192 insertion in combination with external beam treatment is recommended.",
