  "text": "A family study of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.\n Previous studies have demonstrated that Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a familial disorder and that chronic tics (CT) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) appear to be etiologically related to the syndrome.\n In the present study we report the results from a study of 338 biological relatives of 86 TS probands, 21 biologically unrelated relatives of adopted TS probands, and 22 relatives of normal subjects.\n The 43 first-degree relatives of the adopted TS and normal probands constituted a control sample.\n The rates of TS, CT, and OCD in the total sample of biological relatives of TS probands were significantly greater than in the relatives of controls.\n In addition, the morbid risks of TS, OCD, and CT were not significantly different in families of probands with OCD when compared to relatives of probands without OCD.\n These findings provide further evidence that OCD is etiologically related to TS.",
