  "text": "Neurofibromatosis type 2: report of a family and review of current evaluation and treatment.\n Significant advances during the past decade have greatly improved our understanding of neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disease which results in bilateral acoustic neuromas.\n The emergence of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has allowed early detection of minute intracanalicular eighth-nerve tumors, less than 1 cm in diameter.\n Recombinant DNA studies have clarified the genetics that underlie neurofibromatosis type 2 and separate it from a variety of related conditions, such as von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis.\n Early diagnosis and surgical removal of these tumors may offer the only hope of preserving hearing and facial nerve function.\n A report of the evaluation and treatment of a family with multiple affected individuals will exemplify these conclusions.",
