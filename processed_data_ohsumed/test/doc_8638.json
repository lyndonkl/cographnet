  "text": "Human papillomavirus in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n Thirty seven cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were studied by applying DNA slot blot analysis and in situ hybridisation using type specific probes for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n Cases of condyloma accuminata, cervical carcinoma, and laryngeal papilloma were used as controls.\n Blocks including areas of invasive carcinoma, intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal epithelium were studied in each case.\n No HPV genome was detectable in any of the oesophageal cases.\n It is concluded that these types of HPV do not have an association with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",
