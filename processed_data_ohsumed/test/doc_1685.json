  "text": "Epidemiology and natural history of urinary tract infections in children.\n Recent retrospective surveys have supported previous investigations in demonstrating the incidence of UTI during infancy; 0.3% to 1.2% of infants develop symptomatic UTI during the first year of life.\n Boys are more commonly infected during the first 3 months of life.\n After the first year, symptomatic UTI is much more frequent among girls.\n Similarly, asymptomatic bacteriuria is more frequently detected in boys than in girls during the first 12 months of life.\n Thereafter, the incidence decreases markedly in boys but increases in girls.\n Recent investigations indicate that lack of circumcision is a risk factor for UTI among male infants.\n Recurrent UTI is common and frequently asymptomatic.\n The most important microbiologic factor that is associated with E.\n coli causing acute pyelonephritis is adherence mediated by P fimbriae.\n Other factors, such as capsule, lipopolysaccharide, aerobactin production, and serum resistance, also determine the invasiveness of E.\n coli.\n Vesicoureteral reflux appears to be an important host factor predisposing to UTI.\n Microbiologic and host factors that are determinants of renal scarring are under investigation.",
