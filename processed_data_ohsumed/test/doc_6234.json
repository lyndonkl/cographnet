  "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging: a reliable test for the evaluation of proximal atherosclerotic renal arterial stenosis.\n Symptomatic renal artery stenosis is a significant and treatable clinical problem.\n A reliable and accurate noninvasive method of screening for renal artery stenosis has not yet been found.\n We used magnetic resonance imaging to study 37 patients who had undergone recent renal angiography.\n Fourteen patients had normal renal arteries by angiography.\n In 23 patients either unilateral or bilateral stenosis or occlusion was present.\n The disease process in all patients appeared to be atherosclerosis.\n The average age of the 37 patients was 68 years.\n The magnetic resonance scans and angiograms were read independently by two different radiologists, each of whom was blinded to the clinical history and the results of the other study.\n Renal arterial stenoses found on angiogram and magnetic resonance scans were graded as absent (0% to 24%), mild (25% to 49%), moderate (50% to 74%), or severe (75% to 99%).\n The magnetic resonance imaging results concurred with the angiographic findings in 70 of 77 arteries (91%).\n Magnetic resonance imaging predicted the presence of a greater than 50% stenosis of the renal artery with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94%.\n Magnetic resonance imaging may prove to be the best noninvasive screening test for proximal atherosclerotic renal arterial stenosis.",
