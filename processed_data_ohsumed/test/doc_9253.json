  "text": "Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a \"saline torch\".\n The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles.\n Recent advances in optics and miniaturization make the application of endoscopy in neurosurgery more practical.\n The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections.\n These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro.\n Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a \"saline torch\" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope.\n The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum.\n Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision.\n The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others.",
