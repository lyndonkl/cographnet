  "text": "The effects of rate, sequencing, and memory on auditory processing in the elderly.\n Auditory sequencing, rate, and memory were evaluated in three age groups with a series of subtests that require the identification of tones (Repetition Test; Tallal & Piercy, 1973).\n The older elderly group (M age = 80), but not the younger elderly group (M age = 70), performed significantly (p less than .05) poorer than the young adult group (M age = 25) when auditory memory of 4 and 5 tones was required and when the interstimulus interval was decreased.\n Performance was not related to hearing sensitivity, thus suggesting that changes in the auditory mechanism that occur with age may encompass more than a loss of hearing sensitivity.\n Moreover, performance on the Repetition Test did correlate with memory for digits, which indicates a relationship between auditory processing and higher cortical functions.",
