  "text": "Performance of cesarean section using absorbable staples.\n Although stapling techniques have gained wide acceptance in general surgery, they are still not commonly used in obstetrics.\n U.S.\n Surgical Corporation has introduced a stapling device suitable for use in cesarean sections.\n The copolymer staples (a blend of polylactic and polyglycolic acids) maintain their tensile strength until healing occurs and absorb without producing granulation tissue.\n The benefits include minimal trauma to tissue and reduced operating time, blood loss and postoperative morbidity.\n From July 1988 to February 1989, all patients undergoing low transverse cervical cesarean sections were randomized to either group 1 with the uterine incision performed in a routine manner or group 2 with the uterine incision cut and stapled using the Stapler.\n The preoperative management, intraoperative technique and postoperative surveillance were similar for both groups.\n The uterine incision was assessed by pelvic sonography during the postpartum period.\n Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and chi-square analysis.\n Both groups were comparable for age, race, parity, gestational age and primary diagnosis.\n The length of the operative procedure was significantly shorter (p less than 0.05) in the stapled group.\n These patients also had a statistically significantly decreased incidence of uterine incisions and lacerations.\n All other parameters were not significantly different in the two groups.\n The stapled uterine incisions were visible by ultrasonography in more patients in the stapled group throughout the postpartum period than in the sutured group.\n Thus, stapling of the uterine incision was an acceptable alternative to traditional suturing techniques and it was possible to visualize clearly these incisions during the postpartum period.",
