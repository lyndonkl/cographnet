  "text": "Pre-trigeminal neuralgia.\n Eighteen patients who subsequently developed typical trigeminal neuralgia experienced a prodromal pain termed \"pre-trigeminal neuralgia.\" These patients described their prodromal pain as a toothache or sinusitis-like pain lasting up to several hours, sometimes triggered by jaw movements or by drinking hot or cold liquids.\n Typical trigeminal neuralgia developed a few days to 12 years later, and in all cases affected the same division of the trigeminal nerve.\n Six additional patients experiencing what appeared to be pre-trigeminal neuralgia became pain-free when taking carbamazepine or baclofen.\n Recognition of pretrigeminal neuralgia makes it possible to relieve the pain with appropriate medications and avoid unnecessary irreversible dental procedures.",
