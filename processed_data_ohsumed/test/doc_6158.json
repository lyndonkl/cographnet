  "text": "Pulmonary embolization of iodine-125 seeds following prostate implantation.\n The optimal treatment of prostatic carcinoma limited to the gland remains controversial.\n Treatment has included implantation of Iodine-125 seeds via both a suprapubic approach and, more recently, a transperineal technique utilizing ultrasound guidance.\n We recently have noted a heretofore unreported complication with this latter technique, namely, embolization of seeds to the lungs.\n Review of the chest x-ray films of 31 patients who underwent suprapubic implants showed no evidence of this phenomenon.\n One of 5 patients undergoing transperineal implant was found to have seeds lodged in the lung.\n Complications surrounding the various treatments of localized prostate carcinoma are reviewed.",
