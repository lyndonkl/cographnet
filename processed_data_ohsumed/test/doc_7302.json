  "text": "Zygomatic approach to skull-base lesions.\n A modification of the preauricular skull-base approach is described.\n After sectioning and downward displacement of the zygomatic arch, the coronoid process of the mandible is dissected and sectioned at its base.\n The temporal muscle, with its coronoid insertion, is then retracted upward.\n This approach provides direct and unobstructed access to the temporal and infratemporal fossae.\n Adequate vascularity of the temporal muscle is maintained.\n The exposure encompasses the internal carotid artery in the neck for vascular control.\n Extensive reconstruction is eliminated.\n The described technique was used in seven patients with lesions of the skull base.\n There was no operative mortality, and morbidity consisted of temporary restriction of mandibular opening in two patients.",
