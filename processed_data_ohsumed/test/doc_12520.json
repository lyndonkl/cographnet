  "text": "Cor triatriatum dexter: antemortem diagnosis in an adult by cross sectional echocardiography.\n Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare cardiac abnormality in which the right atrium is subdivided into two distinct chambers.\n This anomaly is generally attributed to the persistence of the right sinus venosus valve and it is frequently associated with severe malformations of other right heart structures.\n The antemortem diagnosis of the membrane may be difficult and its presence is often only established at necropsy.\n In a woman of 56 with Ebstein's anomaly the echocardiographic features of cor triatriatum dexter were examined before and during cardiac catheterisation.\n These investigations showed the position of the membrane, that there was no gradient between the two atrial chambers, and that there were perforations in the centre of the membrane.",
