  "text": "Spinal accessory nerve palsy: an unusual complication of coronary artery bypass \n The neurologic complications of coronary artery bypass surgery have been well documented, with a reported incidence of 61% in one large study.\n Most injuries to the peripheral nervous system involve the brachial plexus.\n We report the first case of a spinal accessory nerve lesion after coronary bypass surgery.\n The patient presented with progressive right shoulder weakness.\n Electrodiagnostic studies revealed a partial lesion of the right spinal accessory nerve.\n Physical therapy, including strengthening, range of motion, and electric stimulation to the right shoulder, was prescribed to assist recovery of strength and function.\n Repeat electrodiagnostic studies confirmed nerve regeneration.\n Prompt recognition of spinal accessory nerve damage after coronary bypass surgery is essential.\n Early rehabilitation will improve the chances of a better functional outcome.",
