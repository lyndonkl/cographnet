  "text": "Development of a new surgical procedure for repairing tracheobronchomalacia.\n We have developed a new surgical method for repairing tracheobronchomalacia.\n In experiments on dogs we tried external fixation of Marlex mesh (Bard Cardiosurgery Division, Bellerica, Mass.) on the trachea.\n We first made models of tracheomalacia by making fractures or resections in intrathoracic tracheal cartilages and then made an external fixation of Marlex mesh on the malacic segments of the trachea.\n In 11 dogs Marlex mesh was sutured onto the trachea with absorbable thread.\n The trachea was firmly supported after 2 to 6 months, compared with three controls in which no external fixation was made.\n However, mucosal defects associated with ischemia caused by the suture developed in four of the 11.\n In 13 more dogs Marlex mesh was bonded to the trachea with fibrin glue.\n After 3 to 8 months the supporting strength of the trachea increased up to the level of the normal trachea.\n There was no evidence of inflammation or of mucosal defects.\n Therefore Marlex mesh was applied to a 44-year-old-man who had experienced frequent attacks of cough syncope.\n After the operation the attacks of cough syncope and collapsing of his airway disappeared completely.",
