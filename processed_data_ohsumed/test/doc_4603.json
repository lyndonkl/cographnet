  "text": "How stressful is retirement? Findings from the Normative Aging Study.\n The stressfulness of retirement both as a transitional event experienced during the past year and as a life stage was investigated.\n Transitional stress was assessed using a life events approach, and stage stress using a \"hassles\" approach.\n Respondents were 1,516 male participants in the Normative Aging Study, 45% of whom were retired.\n Among those retiring in the past year, respondents' own and spouse's retirement were rated the least stressful from a list of 31 possible events.\n Only 30% found retirement stressful.\n Retirement hassles were also less frequently reported and were rated less stressful than the work hassles of men still in the labor force.\n The only consistent predictors of both transitional and stage retirement stress were poor health and family finances; personality did not predict retirement stress.",
