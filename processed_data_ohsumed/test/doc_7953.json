  "text": "Subscapular elastofibroma in a young pitcher. A case report.\n Subscapular elastofibromas and scapulothoracic bursitis can cause symptomatic masses in baseball pitchers.\n Both processes appear to represent reactive soft tissue responses to repetitive stress at the inferior border of the scapula.\n It is assumed that most masses in the subscapular area represent scapulothoracic bursitis rather than an elastofibroma.\n However, it is possible that some of the masses treated conservatively as scapulothoracic bursitis may be elastofibromas.\n A study is currently under way to evaluate the incidence of subscapular masses in college and professional pitchers in the United States.\n A follow-up report is anticipated when the study has been completed.\n The author requests information concerning any confirmed cases of elastofibroma in baseball pitchers.",
