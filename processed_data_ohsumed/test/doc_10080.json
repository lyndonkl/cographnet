  "text": "Increased expression of type VI collagen genes in systemic sclerosis.\n The expression of type VI collagen genes in affected skin from patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) was examined by in situ hybridizations with a human alpha 2(VI) collagen sequence-specific complementary DNA.\n Five patients with diffuse, rapidly progressive SSc of recent onset (less than 12 months) were studied.\n The results showed increased expression of alpha 2(VI) collagen messenger RNA transcripts in the skin of scleroderma patients compared with that in the skin of normal subjects.\n These findings indicate that alterations in the expression of type VI collagen genes, similar to those previously described for types I and III collagen, are present in the affected skin of SSc patients.\n These alterations may result in excessive tissue accumulation of type VI collagen and may play a role in the progressive skin induration and sclerosis that are prominent features of SSc.",
