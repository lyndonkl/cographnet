  "text": "Management of urinary tract infections in children.\n Urinary tract infection is common in children.\n The presentation varies with age.\n Younger children exhibit protean signs.\n Diagnosis is dependent on the demonstration of significant bacteriuria in a properly collected and handled urine sample.\n The approach to treatment depends on the degree of illness at presentation, the presence of structural urinary tract abnormalities, and the age of the patient.\n Pathophysiology of urinary tract infection is dependent on interactive factors of the host and of the invading microorganism.\n Urinary tract abnormalities have significant impact on the management of children with urinary tract infections, both medically and surgically.\n Of particular importance is the observation that renal damage usually occurs within the first 5 years of life, and treatment delay in some young patients may have significant consequences.\n The overall prognosis in children with urinary tract infection is favorable.",
