  "text": "Treatment of severe intraventricular hemorrhage by intraventricular infusion of urokinase.\n Six patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage were treated with direct intraventricular infusion of urokinase.\n In each case, hemorrhage extended into all ventricular chambers, and a cast formation and expansion of the third and fourth ventricles were found.\n Immediately after the therapy was started (within 7 days from onset of symptoms), reduction of intraventricular hematoma volume was observed on computerized tomography.\n On average, both the third and fourth ventricles became clear on the third day after hemorrhage; there was one exception, a case of ruptured aneurysm.\n Five of the six patients showed excellent or good outcome, although two developed delayed hydrocephalus.\n No infection or rebleeding was observed.\n The outcome in a retrospectively studied group of five patients not treated with urokinase is also reported.\n The authors conclude that this relatively easy method of treatment will greatly improve the prognosis of severe intraventricular hemorrhage.",
