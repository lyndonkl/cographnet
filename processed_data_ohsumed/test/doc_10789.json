An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter.\n Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer.\n Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD.\n The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).\n Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade.\n She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction.",
