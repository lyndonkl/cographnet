  "text": "Obesity and diabetes in blacks.\n Diabetes mellitus is more prevalent in the American Black population than in the White population.\n The prevalence is increasing in Blacks, and there is evidence that it is accompanied by a greater severity of diabetic complications.\n In addition, mortality figures are higher in Blacks, and Black women are more seriously affected than Black men.\n Although the reasons for this are unclear, some factors stand out as important.\n These include obesity, socioeconomic status, and genetics.\n Obesity is a severe problem in Blacks, particularly in women.\n Both the degree and the distribution of fat may contribute greatly to the prevalence of diabetes in Blacks.\n Although the prevalence of obesity is higher in the poor economic groups, multivariate analysis suggests that poverty cannot explain all of the excess obesity that occurs in the Black population.\n More research is needed into a possible genetic predisposition of Blacks to obesity and diabetes and into the interrelationship between the two conditions in this racial group.",
