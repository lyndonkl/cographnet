  "text": "Chest pain in teenagers. When is it significant?\n Chest pain in teenagers often has no obvious organic cause.\n Onset of symptoms with an emotionally stressful situation may indicate psychogenic chest pain.\n The differential diagnosis also includes cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders.\n Routine testing generally does not help to establish a diagnosis and may even do harm by reinforcing a patient's unspoken fear of serious illness.\n Most teenagers with chest pain have no such illness, and symptoms usually resolve without therapy.\n An important role for primary care physicians is to provide support during evaluation and follow-up.",
