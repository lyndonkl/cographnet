  "text": "Spinal stenosis. When arthritis is more than arthritis!\n Spinal stenosis is the result of disc degeneration and narrowing accompanied by facet joint changes culminating in nerve root entrapment.\n Symptoms of back and leg pain appear gradually usually over a period of years and slowly worsen.\n Patients are usually in their 50s or older.\n Most patients are treated initially with nonoperative measures concentrating on pain relief and maintenance of activity.\n If the symptoms worsen, surgical intervention to relieve pain by decompressing the affected nerve roots is appropriate.\n Some patients with instability require a fusion.\n Most patients are satisfied with the results of surgery in relieving preoperative leg pain.\n Pain relief is often dramatic, allowing most patients to return to normal activity.\n Elderly patients tolerate this procedure surprisingly well.\n Old age alone should not be a contra-indication for this surgery.\n Therefore, the elderly should not be denied the benefits of surgical decompression.\n Nursing interventions can help these patients learn about spinal stenosis and assist them in pursuing appropriate treatment resulting in improved quality of living.",
