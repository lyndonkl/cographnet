  "text": "Progress in the search for genetic linkage with Tourette syndrome: an exclusion map covering more than 50% of the autosomal genome.\n Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and reduced penetrance at a single genetic locus.\n Several research groups have genetic linkage studies underway to detect the chromosomal location of the gene that predisposes for this disorder.\n Strong and clear evidence of linkage has not yet been produced for Tourette syndrome.\n This paper presents an overview of the methods and progress of the groups centered at Yale University and Erasmus University in excluding linkage from a large portion of the genome.\n Our labs have screened 228 genetic marker loci for linkage with a gene for this disorder in a series of affected families in the United States, Canada, The Netherlands, and Norway.\n More than 50% (and perhaps as much as 66%) of the autosomal genome has now been excluded on the assumption that genetic heterogeneity is not an important factor in the Tourette syndrome pedigrees pooled for this summary.",
