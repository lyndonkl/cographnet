  "text": "Response of discoid and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus to recombinant interferon alpha 2a.\n Ten patients suffering from discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) were treated with interferon alpha 2a.\n A marked improvement or clearing of cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesions was observed in eight of them.\n However, the response to interferon was of short duration and within a few weeks after interferon withdrawal all patients who were improved or cleared relapsed.\n This study suggests that interferon alpha 2a represents a new interesting approach in the treatment of DLE and SCLE.\n Ongoing trials will define the optimal treatment schedule for the maintenance of interferon-induced improvement of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.",
