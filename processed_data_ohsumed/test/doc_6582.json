  "text": "Erythroid colony growth from peripheral blood and bone marrow in polycythaemia.\n Erythroid colony growth in the presence and absence of erythropoietin was compared in 23 patients with primary proliferative polycythaemia (PPP), nine with idiopathic erythrocytosis, 10 with secondary polycythaemia, 15 with pseudopolycythaemia and in 76 normal subjects.\n Erythroid colonies growing without erythropoietin stimulation (endogenous erythroid colonies) from peripheral blood (BFU-E) were found in 20 of 22 patients with PPP and in two of seven with idiopathic erythrocytosis.\n None was found in secondary polycythaemia, pseudopolycythaemia, or in normal subjects.\n Small numbers of endogenous colony forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) (though not BFU-E) were cultured from the bone marrow of three of 24 normal subjects, suggesting that peripheral blood cultures provide a more specific indicator of clonal erythropoiesis.\n Peripheral blood endogenous erythroid colony growth is an effective and convenient means of distinguishing patients with clonal erythrocytosis and may be of particular value when iron deficiency obscures the diagnosis of PPP on conventional criteria.",
