  "text": "The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa.\n The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking.\n When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater.\n The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle.\n We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects.\n The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail.",
