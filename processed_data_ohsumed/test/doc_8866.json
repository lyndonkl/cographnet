  "text": "Usefulness of serum glycoconjugates in precancerous and cancerous diseases of the oral cavity.\n Sera from 47 healthy controls, 18 normal individuals with the habit of tobacco chewing, 43 patients with oral precancerous (PC) conditions, and 40 patients with oral cancer (OC) were studied for the levels of total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LSA), mucoid proteins, and protein-bound hexoses (PBH) (galactose and mannose).\n The changes in the glycoconjugate levels were insignificant between the controls and the normal tobacco chewers.\n All four parameters were significantly elevated in oral PC patients compared with controls.\n The levels of PBH and LSA showed significant increase in the oral PC patients compared with the normal tobacco chewers.\n A significant increase was observed in the levels of TSA, LSA, mucoid proteins, and PBH in OC patients compared with controls, normal tobacco chewers, and patients with oral PC.\n Increasing levels of all the biomarkers were found with progression of the malignant disease.\n Elevations in the levels of TSA and LSA were statistically significant in Stage IV patients compared with Stage III patients.\n The patients with metastases had higher levels of the biomarkers than the patients with primary OC.\n However, elevations only in LSA levels were statistically significant.\n These results suggest that evaluations of the serum glycoconjugate levels may be useful in diagnosis of the patients with oral PC or OC.\n In addition to their value in early detection, they can also help in staging of the disease.",
