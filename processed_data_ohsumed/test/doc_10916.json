  "text": "Death, after swallowing and aspiration of a high number of foreign bodies, in a schizophrenic woman.\n A 46-year-old woman who had had a long-term schizoid psychosis collapsed on the street.\n Upon admission to the hospital, she was determined to have an acute abdomen.\n The chest radiograph showed metallic foreign bodies in both main bronchi; foreign bodies in the stomach were not observed clinically.\n The woman died from repeated cardiac arrest shortly after hospital admission.\n At the autopsy a screw and a nail were found in both main bronchi.\n The abdominal cavity contained 2 L of greenish purulent fluid and a massive fibrinoid peritonitis was observed.\n Two perforations of the stomach, each 1 cm in diameter, were detected.\n The stomach was completely filled with a mass of metallic foreign bodies, greenish fluid, and a bezoar of a total weight of 1,400 g; 422 distinguishable and mostly metallic foreign bodies were counted.\n Death was attributed to cardiac arrest in delayed shock after massive purulent peritonitis caused by two gastric perforations combined with obstruction of the airways by aspirated foreign bodies.\n Cases of massive swallowing of foreign bodies are mainly restricted to mentally handicapped persons, especially schizophrenics, whereas acute impaction of the larynx by large food particles occurs nearly exclusively in heavily intoxicated adults.",
