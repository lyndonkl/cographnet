  "text": "Preliminary report: protection of cynomolgus macaques against simian immunodeficiency virus by fixed infected-cell vaccine \n Cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated with inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus-infected cells and 'Quil-A' as adjuvant at 0, 4, 8, and 36 weeks or at 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks.\n 2 weeks later these animals, together with a similar unvaccinated group, were challenged with 10 MID50 (50% monkey infectious doses) of a pool of SIVmac251 previously titrated in vivo.\n Virus was repeatedly isolated from unvaccinated animals on at least five separate occasions and proviral DNA was detected in circulating lymphocytes by polymerase chain reaction amplification.\n By contrast, virus and proviral DNA were not found in any of the vaccinated animals.\n However, the same vaccination regimen used after live virus challenge did not eliminate virus from previously infected macaques.",
