  "text": "The use of bromodeoxyuridine cytokinetic studies as a prognostic indicator of cancer of the head and neck.\n Traditional measures of head and neck tumors often fail to predict patient outcome or clinical course, particularly in nonadvanced disease.\n This problem of unpredictable tumor behavior has been one focus of cell proliferation studies.\n Such studies, however, have been limited by difficult methodology.\n A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study.\n The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made.",
