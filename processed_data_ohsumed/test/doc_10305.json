  "text": "Drinking in college: consumption patterns, problems, sex differences and legal drinking age.\n Data from 606 (75.8%) undergraduate respondents drawn from a random sample (N = 800) at Rutgers University demonstrate that, although fewer college students may be drinking when compared to some previous estimates, there is still a large number of heavy drinkers.\n In addition, traditional demographic variables continue to predict alcohol consumption levels.\n Students also report a similar variety of drinking related problems as in previous college drinking studies.\n Women constitute half as many heavy drinkers as men, but report an equal amount of alcohol-related problems in this sample.\n When controlling for race, it appears that white students continue to drink the most, and show heavy drinking rates comparable to a previous large college sample in the northeast.\n Students who live on campus drink more than their commuting counterparts, and the drinking age has little effect on consumption levels or total reported alcohol-related problems, although it alters the context of drinking somewhat.\n Findings are generally compared to previous as well as more recent college drinking data.\n Sex differences and similarities are discussed, as well as the findings concerning legal drinking status.\n Implications for prevention efforts are suggested.",
