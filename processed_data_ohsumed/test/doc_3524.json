  "text": "Adult respiratory distress syndrome during pregnancy and immediately postpartum.\n From 1976 to 1983, the adult respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 14 patients during pregnancy or within a month postpartum.\n There were 8 survivors, giving a 43% mortality.\n All but 2 patients had obstetric-related precipitating events--labor problems, infections, eclampsia-toxemia, and obstetric hemorrhages.\n During emergency cesarean sections, 3 patients had respiratory problems that may have caused their respiratory distress syndrome.\n The average duration of mechanical ventilatory support was 16 days.\n Six patients had barotrauma with 1 patient sustaining an irreversible anoxic central nervous system injury.\n Infections were documented in 8 patients, 6 of whom had obstetric foci.\n There is a lack of information regarding the adult respiratory distress syndrome in this patient group.\n Though uncommon, it can cause substantial mortality and morbidity.",
