  "text": "Osteosarcoma in young children.\n The clinicopathologic features of osteosarcoma in 12 children younger than 16 years of age treated at The Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, during a 70-year time period are presented.\n Only one of six children treated before 1972 is a long-term survivor.\n Four of six children (67%) treated after 1972 are disease-free with an average follow-up of 8.8 years.\n The year 1972 marked the onset of use of effective chemotherapy in osteosarcoma, namely, high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue.\n It would appear that the pathologic features and behavior of osteosarcoma in young children is similar to that of osteosarcoma in older children and adolescents.\n A combination of complete (wide) surgical resection or amputation and aggressive chemotherapy offers the best chance of long-term survival.",
