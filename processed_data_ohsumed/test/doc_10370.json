  "text": "Unintentional injury death rates in rural Appalachia.\n Rural unintentional injury (UI) death rates are higher than rates for urban regions.\n Our trauma center serves 49 rural Appalachian (AP) counties in a 120-county rural state.\n We investigated the impact of prehospital and hospital resources on UI death rates in our referral area.\n Age-adjusted and average age- and sex-specific UI death rates from 1979-1985 were compared among 49 rural AP counties, the 71 non-Appalachian (NAP) counties, and the United States.\n Counties were grouped for comparisons by level of prehospital care (Advanced Life Support [ALS] vs.\n Basic Life Support [BLS]) and by presence (H) or absence (NH) of a hospital.\n Death rates were calculated using data from the 1980 population census, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and state vital statistics.\n Within AP, all 49 counties have ambulance service.\n Only 9/49 (18%) have ALS service and 13/49 (26%) have no hospital.\n Age-specific AP rates were higher than NAP and US rates in the 25-44 and 45-64 year age groups.\n AP death rates were highest for BLS and NH counties across all age groups.\n Rural UI death rates in the region remain unacceptably high.\n The reason(s) that AP death rates exceed the NAP rates is uncertain.\n ALS service and an available hospital were associated with lower death rates.\n We propose both educational and epidemiologic programs to better identify and define additional problems.",
