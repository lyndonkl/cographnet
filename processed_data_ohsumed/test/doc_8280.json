  "text": "Pattern of urological malignancy in Zambia. A hospital-based histopathological study.\n The pattern of urological malignancy among the indigenous population of Zambia (determined on the basis of histopathological reports from a major national hospital during an 8-year period) is presented.\n A total of 6514 malignancies were observed, of which 784 (12%) were of urological origin.\n Bladder carcinoma, predominantly squamous type, was the commonest urological tumour (51%), followed by carcinoma of the prostate (26%), carcinoma of the penis (18%), renal tumours (4.3%) and testicular malignancy (0.7%).\n In nearly 32% of the bladder tumours, bilharzial ova were demonstrated histopathologically.\n Nephroblastoma accounted for 70% of the renal tumours and from a total of 7 cases of testicular tumours 5 were embryonal carcinoma and 2 seminoma.\n A brief reference is made to the pattern and aetiology of urological malignancies in some neighbouring countries.",
