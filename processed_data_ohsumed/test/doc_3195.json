  "text": "Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates presenting as occipital neuralgia.\n A retrospective review of 46 patients with biopsy-proven giant cell (temporal) arteritis revealed 8 (17%) whose initial presentation was occipital pain.\n The most likely etiology of occipital pain in these patients was occipital artery inflammation.\n A Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate less than 40 mm/hour was noted at presentation in 6 of these 8 patients.\n Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of elderly patients who present with occipital pain and demonstrate a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.",
