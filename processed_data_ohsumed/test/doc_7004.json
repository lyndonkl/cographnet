  "text": "HIV prevalence in a midwestern emergency department.\n STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity of patients 15 years of age and older in our emergency department.\n DESIGN: HIV status was determined anonymously, and the seroprevalence rate was calculated.\n The 95% confidence intervals also were calculated.\n Twenty demographic and predictor categorical variable were cross-tabulated with HIV status to determine associations.\n Only gender and male homosexual preference were significantly associated by Fisher's exact test.\n TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Excess serum samples from 454 randomly selected patients 15 years of age and older who required venipuncture for their ED evaluation were included in the study.\n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 454 serum specimens, six (1.32%) were positive for HIV.\n The 95% confidence interval was from 0.27% to 2.37%.\n All six positive patients were men.\n The only statistically significant risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity were male sex (P = .00112) and male homosexual preference (P = .0000).\n CONCLUSION: HIV seropositivity occurs in 1.32% of our ED population over the age of 15 years.\n The only factors that correlate with HIV seropositivity are male homosexual preference and male sex.",
