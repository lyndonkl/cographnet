  "text": "AIDS in the transfusion recipient.\n In summary, the HIV virus was transmitted to approximately 90% of recipients by infectious blood and blood products transfused prior to donor and product testing begun in March 1985.\n Self-elimination of at-risk donors several years prior to testing donor blood helped to reduce the number of infected donations.\n Virtually all contaminated donors are now eliminated.\n The multiply transfused patient developed a stimulated dysregulated immune system due to the numerous antigens and the iron in red cells and plasma.\n This dysregulated immune system has resulted in a variable response to the added exposure of the HIV virus.\n The incubation period and progression to disease have been prolonged and variable.\n Although a small number of patients have progressed as rapidly as other at-risk groups, many continue to do well without therapeutic intervention.\n Natural history of the disease needs continual monitoring to determine the ultimate outcome of these transfusion recipients.",
