  "text": "Autograft versus allograft for benign lesions in children.\n Benign bone lesions in children are often so large in size that there is not an adequate amount of bone available for an autograft to fill the resultant cavity after surgical curettage.\n This study compared autografts and allografts with respect to the time required and the success of graft incorporation.\n Fifty-four patients with 61 lesions were studied.\n Lesions were classified as small volume (less than 60 cc) or large volume (more than 60 cc) and were separated into four groups: small-volume autograft, large-volume autograft, small-volume allograft, and large-volume allograft.\n Allografts appeared comparable to autografts when small-volume lesions were treated.\n The healing time was slightly longer for allografts with an average period of 21 months versus 27 months for autografts.\n Autografts were superior to allografts in rate and completeness of healing for solitary large lesions.\n This increased efficacy presumes a somewhat older child in which an adequate amount of bone is available for an autograft.\n A young child with multicentric or polyostotic lesions can still achieve successful incorporation with allografts.\n In this study, 38% healed completely and 29% healed partially.\n Allografts have a distinct place in the treatment of benign bone lesions in children.",
