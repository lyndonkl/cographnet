  "text": "Ewing's sarcoma. Prognostic factors, disease control, and the reemerging role of surgical treatment.\n Advances in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma have been dramatic.\n Present treatment protocols control local disease by radiotherapy, surgery, or both; systemic spread is limited by aggressive multiagent chemotherapy.\n In patients with localized osseous Ewing's sarcoma, five-year survival rates now range from 54% to an estimated 74%.\n With late relapse not uncommon, control of the primary lesion is critical to long-term survival.\n Several studies now show improved local control and possibly improved survival of patients with surgical treatment of primary osseous Ewing's sarcoma.",
