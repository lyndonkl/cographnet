  "text": "Characterization of herpes simplex virus type 2 latency-associated transcription in human sacral ganglia and in cell culture.\n The ability of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) to establish latency in and reactivate from sacral dorsal root sensory ganglia is the basis for recurrent genital herpes.\n The expression of HSV-2 genes in latently infected human sacral ganglia was investigated by in situ hybridization.\n Hybridizations with a probe from the long repeat region of HSV-2 revealed strong nuclear signals overlying neurons in sacral ganglia from five of nine individuals.\n The RNA detected overlaps with the transcript for infected cell protein O but in the opposite, or \"anti-sense,\" orientation.\n These observations mimic those made previously with HSV-1 in human trigeminal ganglia and confirm the recent findings during latency in HSV-2-infected mice and guinea pigs.\n Northern hybridization of RNA from infected Vero cells showed that an HSV-2 latency-associated transcript was similar in size to the larger (1.85 kb) latency transcript of HSV-1.\n Thus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 latency in human sensory ganglia are similar, if not identical, in terms of their cellular localization and pattern of transcription.",
