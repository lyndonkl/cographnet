First clinical results with tumor-cell vaccines modified with live but avirulent Newcastle disease virus [published erratum appears in Cancer 1991 Apr 15;67(8):2124]\n Sixteen patients with colorectal carcinoma Dukes' Stage B2, C, or D were treated with an autologous virus-modified tumor-cell vaccine after potential curative tumor resection (R0-Resection).\n An inoculum of 1 X 10(7) cells incubated with 32 hemagglutination units of nonirradiated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was given intracutaneously up to four times at 10-day intervals.\n The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reaction was measured.\n The vaccination was well tolerated.\n In 11 of 16 patients an increasing reactivity against the vaccine was observed during the vaccination procedure.\n A challenge test using autologous tumor cells without NDV after the vaccination cycle revealed a specific antitumor sensibilization in 12 patients.\n The DTH response was not due to bacterial contamination or sensibility to the virus.\n Histologic examination of the vaccination site showed a dense infiltration of predominantly helper T-lymphocytes.\n We conclude that in most of the patients treated active, specific immunization led to a specific antitumor sensitivity.",
