  "text": "Pterygia: single-fraction postoperative beta irradiation.\n A retrospective evaluation was performed with records of 128 patients with 146 eyes that underwent applications of strontium-90 after pterygium excisions performed between 1982 and 1988.\n With a median follow-up of 13 months, 135 eyes were evaluable.\n Most pterygia (127 of 135) were treated with a single postoperative application of Sr-90 that delivered 3,000 cGy of beta radiation in one fraction.\n The actuarial freedom from relapse was 87%; all recurrences occurred within the first 18 months, and 46% of these within the first 3 months.\n Of the 13 recurrences, 10 have been re-treated with surgery and a second course of beta irradiation with excellent results.\n All eight eyes for which follow-up was available had no evidence of disease.\n The ultimate control rate was 96.3% for the series.\n Correlation of various treatment parameters, including age, bilaterality, prior recurrence, and interval from surgery to irradiation, was performed, and no statistically significant difference was seen.\n No serious complications have developed.\n Transient conjunctivitis and photophobia were almost universally seen, with five cases lasting beyond 5 months.\n The authors conclude that a single application of Sr-90 after surgery is effective and safe in managing pterygia.",
