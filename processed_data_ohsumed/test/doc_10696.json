  "text": "Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. II. Standardized clinical assessment of current and lifetime psychopathology.\n Despite numerous reports of the psychiatric consequences of human immunodeficiency virus infection, few reports describe systematic diagnostic assessments of people with human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n We studied the results of standardized clinical assessments of current and lifetime psychopathology in a large group of homosexual men whose serologic status was known.\n Results indicated low rates of current mental disorders but very high rates of lifetime major depression and alcohol and other psychoactive substance abuse and dependence disorders.\n Measures of severity of psychopathology and functioning also indicated, on the whole, good current functioning.\n No significant relationship was found between stage of medical illness or immune status and any measure of psychiatric disturbance.",
