  "text": "Immediate closed reduction of cervical spine dislocations using traction.\n Cervical facet dislocations may be reduced rapidly and effectively using axial traction with weights applied at over the traditional 45-pound limit.\n Fifty-three sequential patients with cervical facet dislocations were reviewed.\n Thirty-nine patients required more than 50 pounds of traction to achieve rapid reduction.\n Sixty-eight percent of the entire series showed significant improvement in neurologic function.\n There were no cases of significant loss of function.\n A cadaver study confirmed that the cranial tongs could support over 100 pounds of traction.\n Careful application of up to 100 pounds seems to be associated with a low risk of neurologic compromise or tong failure, but results in effective reduction of dislocations.",
