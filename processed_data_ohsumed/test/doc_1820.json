  "text": "One-stage closure of the entire primary palate.\n Timing of the closure of the anterior palate and alveolus is a subject of debate.\n Late repair of this defect is complicated by high fistula formation and subjects the patient to the problems of palate fistula for extended periods of time.\n We have utilized a single procedure performed when the child is 3 months of age that completely closes the anterior hard palate and alveolus along with the cleft lip.\n Our series consisted of 61 consecutive patients with unilateral clefts of the primary and secondary palate.\n Mucosal turnover flaps from the vomer along with lateral nasal mucosal flaps provide the nasal lining.\n A buccal sulcus flap with a Veau flap completes the oral repair.\n Ninety-five percent (58 of 61) of the patients had complete and stable closure of their anterior palate and alveolus after 1 year.\n The incidence of fistula formation in our series (3 of 61) is much lower than that reported with the utilization of other protocols.\n Excellent exposure of the anterior palate and alveolar defect during lip repair, early restoration of anatomic relationships, establishment of a good nostril floor and sill, and very low fistula formation are among the benefits of this procedure.\n The increase in operative time is considered minimal in light of aforementioned advantages.",
