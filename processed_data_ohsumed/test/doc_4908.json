  "text": "Biliary pain in postcholecystectomy patients without biliary obstruction. A prospective radionuclide study.\n Biliary pain without obvious biliary obstruction is common in postcholecystectomy patients.\n We studied 20 symptomatic patients with episodes of biliary-type pain after cholecystectomy (all having undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiography), and in 18 asymptomatic postcholecystectomy controls.\n We performed quantitative hepatobiliary radionuclide analysis with dimethyl-imidodiacetic acid.\n From a series of 90 dynamic images at 1-min intervals using a gamma camera coupled to a computer, time-activity curves were produced in regions of interest in the liver, intrahepatic biliary tree, common duct, and heart, from which quantitative biliary excretion indexes were obtained.\n The results demonstrate a biliary kinetic dysfunction in patients with postcholecystectomy pain without morphological abnormalities.",
