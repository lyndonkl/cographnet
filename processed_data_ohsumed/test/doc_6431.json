  "text": "Total androgen ablation: Canadian experience.\n A multicenter randomized, double-blind trial comparing total androgen blockade obtained by the use of castration with a pure anti-androgen (nilutamide) with simple castration was begun.\n One hundred and five patients received the combined treatment and 103 the orchiectomy plus placebo.\n Several features were used to evaluate the efficacy.\n Bone pain responded better to combined treatment at 6 months (P = 0.042).\n The number of favorable responses, as evaluated by the NPCP criteria, was 61% with simple castration and 78% with the combined treatment (P = 0.013).\n There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in time to progression (logrank test P = 0.462) or survival (logrank test P = 0.137) despite an increase in median survival of 5.4 months.\n All other measures showed no difference between the two treatments.\n With total androgen blockade, 50% of the patients had disease progression at 1 year, and 45% were dead at 2 years.\n A review of the results of similar reported studies suggests no improvement or very modest improvement with total androgen blockade over testicular androgen ablation alone.",
