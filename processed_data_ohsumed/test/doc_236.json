  "text": "Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide combination as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer: a meta-analytic review.\n Twenty-three patients with marginally resectable and unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (stages IIIA and IIIB) were treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n All patients received three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with two alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide 2.5 g/m2 intravenously (i.v.) and ifosfamide 3.5 g/m2 i.v., mesna 12 g/m2 was given additionally to prevent drug hematuria.\n Six of 23 patients (26%) had partial response.\n Of the seven patients who underwent thoracotomy, two were completely resected, but with macroscopic residual disease.\n Mean time to progression for the whole group was 7 months.\n Fifteen patients had progression of disease, with local metastases only in six, and distant metastases in eight.\n After administering 52 chemotherapy cycles, cyclophosphamide-ifosfamide doses were cut down, as eight of 16 patients required hospitalization for fever during neutropenia nadirs.\n This two-alkylating (non-cisplatin) regimen, unlike cisplatin-based regimens, was ineffective, and further trials are not recommended.",
