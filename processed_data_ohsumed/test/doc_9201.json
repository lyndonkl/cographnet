  "text": "Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures.\n Age at 1st risk for seizures may predict anomia following dominant anterior temporal lobectomy.\n We assessed confrontation naming before and 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in 45 right-handed patients grouped by side of focus and presence or absence of early (less than or equal to 5 years) risk factors.\n After left lobectomy, 6 of 10 (60%) patients with no early risks demonstrated significant decline (greater than or equal to 25%) in naming, but none of the patients with early risks showed this decline.\n After right lobectomy, there was no change.\n Cerebral representation of naming may be atypical in patients with early risks.",
