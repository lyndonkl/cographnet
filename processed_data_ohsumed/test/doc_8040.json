  "text": "Epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated papillomavirus infection complicating human immunodeficiency virus disease.\n Three males infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were noted to have extensive flat warts of the face and/or body.\n In two there were also pityriasis versicolor-like lesions.\n Biopsies showed foamy, basophilic, distended cytoplasm in granular layer keratinocytes, characteristic of the human papillomavirus types seen in epidermodysplasia verruciformis.\n DNA hybridization techniques demonstrated the presence of HPV-type 8 in one patient and HPV 5 and 8 in another.\n Patients with immune suppression due to HIV infection may demonstrate the clinical features of epidermodysplasia verruciformis with the same potentially oncogenic HPV types.",
