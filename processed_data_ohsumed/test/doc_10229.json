  "text": "Cutaneous manifestations of the L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: a spectrum of sclerodermatous skin disease.\n The natural history of the clinical and pathologic features of skin disease was reviewed prospectively in 30 patients with the L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.\n Overall, cutaneous manifestations developed in 26 patients (87%).\n Early lesions were nonspecific and characterized predominantly by an erythematous macular eruption on the trunk and extremities.\n The most characteristic abnormality noted was the spectrum of sclerodermatous disease in 15 patients (50%) often after a subacute stage of peripheral or truncal edema.\n Clinical and/or biopsy evidence of eosinophilic fasciitis was seen in nine patients (30%).\n Findings consistent with diffuse, limited, or localized scleroderma were subsequently observed in nine patients (33%).\n Small mucinous papules, similar to those seen in scleromyxedema, were found in five patients (17%).\n Alopecia, frequently a late sequela, developed in 11 (37%).\n Common histologic features included papillary dermal fibrosis, dermal and fascial infiltrates consisting of mononuclear cells and eosinophils, deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis, and, in some patients, numerous mast cells.",
