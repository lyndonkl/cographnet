  "text": "Treatment of candidosis in severely injured adults with short-course, low-dose amphotericin B.\n Thirty-three (0.7%) of 4,818 trauma patients admitted between January 1, 1987, and July 1, 1989, developed invasive candidosis requiring IV antifungal therapy.\n All patients were seriously traumatized.\n Before developing candidosis, all patients had documented bacterial infections.\n These infections were generally polymicrobial and were treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics (an average of 5.4 antibiotics for 17.2 days).\n Twenty-eight (85%) of 33 patients received enteral feedings for an average of 11 days +/- 1.5 (SEM) before developing candidosis and 24 (73%) received NG/oral nystatin for an average of 7.6 days +/- 0.9 before developing candidosis.\n All patients with candidosis were treated with intravenous amphotericin B: cumulative dose of 157.3 mg +/- 31.3 mg given over 10 days +/- 1.1.\n One patient developed recurrent candidosis despite NG/oral prophylaxis and enteral feedings.\n Six patients (18%) died due to sepsis and multiple organ failure.\n The patients who died did not objectively differ from the survivors.\n Candidosis is an infrequent infection in severely injured patients.\n Candidosis was invariably preceded by treatment with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics for a variety of polymicrobial bacterial infections.\n NG/oral nystatin and enteral feedings did not prevent candidosis, in contrast to widely accepted beliefs.\n Amphotericin B therapy was safe.\n Recurrent candidosis was unusual.\n Candida infections had a high mortality rate associated with multiple blood transfusions and prolonged hospitalization.\n Candidosis represents a sign of severe injury and illness but can be amenable to prompt, aggressive treatment.",
