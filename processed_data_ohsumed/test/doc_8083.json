  "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection of megakaryocytic cells.\n The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is capable of infecting certain cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly monocyte-macrophages and T lymphocytes.\n Recently, the possibility that cells of megakaryocytic lineage are susceptible to HIV infection has been raised.\n We have characterized infection of the permanent megakaryocytic cell line CMK by HIV in vitro.\n CMK cells were easily infected by HIV type 2 (HIV-2), producing significant amounts of virus in culture.\n Infection appeared to be mediated by the CD4 surface antigen on CMK cells.\n Three different strains of HIV-1 were able to minimally infect CMK cells, suggesting there may be isolates of HIV tropic for megakaryocytes.\n Infection of CMK cells led to downregulation of the CD4 surface antigen but no discernable change in expression of megakaryocyte-associated proteins glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.\n These observations support the likelihood that megakaryocytes are susceptible to HIV infection, and cell lines of megakaryocytic origin may provide a useful model to study effects of the retrovirus on megakaryocyte function.",
