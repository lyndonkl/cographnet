  "text": "First- and second-trimester diagnosis of fetal ocular defects and associated anomalies: report of eight cases.\n Ocular cataract, hypertelorism, hypotelorism, anophthalmos, and microphthalmos are rare malformations commonly associated with other fetal anomalies.\n Previously, ocular malformations were detected only after mid-gestation.\n Transvaginal sonography allows the detection of many structural fetal anomalies.\n We describe the case reports of eight ocular anomalies among 1600 fetal screenings by transvaginal sonography at 12-18 weeks' gestation.\n Severe cataract was correctly diagnosed by transvaginal sonography.\n However, transvaginal sonography failed to detect moderate cataract in a case of repeat cataract in a subsequent gestation.\n Anophthalmia may sometimes be secondary to a degenerative process in middle and late pregnancy.\n In five of the eight described cases, the eye malformations were associated with defects of the central nervous system.",
