  "text": "DNA sequences 3' of the Ig H chain cluster rearrange in mouse B cell lines.\n A mouse myeloma cell line MPC11 (IgG2b, kappa) and variants derived from it have been used to study DNA rearrangements that occur at the Ig H chain locus.\n One variant, F5.5, has acquired both VH gene and C epsilon gene rearrangements.\n Through genomic Southern blot analysis initially directed to mapping the C epsilon gene rearrangement, we observed that the VH region rearrangement was linked, through an inversion event, to sequences that originate 3' of the CH cluster, i.e., 3' of the C alpha gene.\n Subsequent studies have shown that DNA rearrangements within the region 3' of the C alpha gene are detected in several other mouse myeloma and hybridoma cell lines and are not associated with the expression of specific isotypes.",
