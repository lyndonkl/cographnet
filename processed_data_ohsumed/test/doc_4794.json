  "text": "Characteristics of accessory pathways exhibiting decremental conduction.\n The prevalence, electrophysiologic characteristics and functional significance of decremental conduction over an accessory pathway were examined in this retrospective study of 653 patients who had an accessory pathway demonstrated at electrophysiologic study.\n Decremental conduction was identified in 50 patients (7.6%).\n In 15 patients with anterograde decremental conduction, the accessory pathway was right parietal or septal in 14 patients and left parietal in 1 patient.\n In the 40 patients with retrograde decrement, the accessory pathway was left parietal in 19, posteroseptal in 13, right parietal in 2 and right anteroseptal in 6 patients.\n Anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 11 of the 40 patients with retrograde decrement.\n Retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 9 patients with anterograde decrement.\n There was no significant difference in the accessory pathway effective refractory period, or shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction over the accessory pathway in anterograde and retrograde directions.\n The shortest RR interval in atrial fibrillation between 2 preexcited QRS complexes was longer in patients with anterograde decremental conduction than in a control group of patients with anterograde-conducting accessory pathways without decremental properties.\n These data demonstrate that decremental conduction over accessory pathways is uncommon.\n Anterograde decremental conduction usually occurs in right-sided or septal pathways that often do not conduct in the retrograde direction.",
