  "text": "Treatment of renal colic by prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors and avafortan (analgesic antispasmodic).\n In a study of the pain-relieving effect of 3 drugs commonly used to treat acute renal colic in this hospital, intravenous indomethacin and intramuscular diclofenac (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors) were compared with intravenous Avafortan (analgesic antispasmodic).\n As first-line analgesics, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, if given intravenously, offer an effective alternative to Avafortan.\n Of 145 patients studied, 32 required a second injection for complete relief of pain.\n Administering a second dose of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors resulted in equally significant pain relief rate even though the route was intramuscular.",
