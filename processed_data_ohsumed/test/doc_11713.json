  "text": "Identification of functionally distinct domains of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor using monoclonal antibodies.\n Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a glycoprotein that is required for the survival, growth, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.\n Although the primary structure of GM-CSF is known from cDNA cloning, the relationship between structure and function of GM-CSF is not fully understood.\n Fifteen different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human GM-CSF were generated to map immunologically distinct areas of the molecule.\n Each of the MoAbs was biotinylated and shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to bind to recombinant GM-CSF that had been affixed to a solid phase.\n Each of the 15 unconjugated MoAbs was then used to compete with each biotinylated MoAb for binding to GM-CSF.\n These cross-blocking studies identified eight distinct epitopes of native GM-CSF.\n Seven of these epitopes were also present in denatured GM-CSF by Western blotting, and four of the epitopes were at least partially conserved on GM-CSF that was reduced in beta-mercaptoethanol.\n MoAbs to four of eight epitopes neutralized both recombinant (glycosylated and nonglycosylated) and natural human GM-CSF in a GM colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assay and blocked GM-CSF-induced activation of neutrophils.\n For most of the antibodies there was a good correlation between neutralizing activity and the capacity to block binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils or blasts.\n Non-neutralizing antibodies to one epitope partially blocked binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils.\n None of the MoAbs neutralized interleukin-3, G-CSF, or M-CSF.\n The locations of seven of the epitopes could be partially mapped with regard to the amino acid structure by determining reactivity to GM-CSF synthetic peptides or to human-mouse chimeric GM-CSFs.\n The neutralizing antibodies were found to map to amino acids 40-77, 78-94, or 110-127.\n Thus, these MoAbs are useful to identify functional domains of GM-CSF and in identifying regions that are likely to be involved in receptor interaction.",
