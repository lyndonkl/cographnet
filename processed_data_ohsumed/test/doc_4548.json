A diagnostic challenge.\n Chilaiditi's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and chest pain.\n Although interposition of the right colon is a relatively common radiologic finding, there is a distinct paucity of information in the medical literature.\n Chilaiditi's syndrome is usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, conservative treatment is usually effective.\n Recognition is important because this syndrome can be mistaken for more serious abnormalities, which may lead to unnecessary surgical intervention.",
