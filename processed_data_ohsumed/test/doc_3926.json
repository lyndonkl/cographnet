  "text": "Varicella with delayed hemiplegia.\n We report 4 children who developed acute hemiplegia 7 weeks to 4 months after varicella infection.\n In 2 patients, carotid angiography demonstrated segmental narrowing and occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.\n Their clinical and angiographic features were similar to those associated with contralateral hemiplegia after herpes zoster ophthalmicus, the pathogenesis of which comprises cerebral angiitis due to varicella zoster viral infection.\n We believe that our patients had the same pathogenesis.\n In a survey of infectious diseases in our region, the frequency of varicella with delayed hemiparesis was roughly 1:6,500 varicella patients.",
