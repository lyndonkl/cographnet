  "text": "Acute and chronic bioeffects of single and multiple doses of piezoelectric shockwaves (EDAP LT.01).\n Piezoelectric second generation lithotriptors are an established means of administering extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) enabling treatment to be performed without anaesthesia or analgesia, but higher shockwave doses and multiple or staged treatment are frequently required.\n The bioeffects of this modality of ESWL, therefore, require further assessment.\n Seven experimental groups of adult male rabbits were treated using the EDAP LT.01 in order to determine the acute and chronic bioeffects of clinical dose, excess dose, divided excess dose, high frequency and multiple treatment (X10) piezoelectric shockwaves (PSW).\n Renal function was measured before and after treatment using mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG 3) scans.\n Gross and histological morphological changes were assessed at one and 30 days following application of PSW.\n Application of single clinical dose PSW was not associated with any significant functional or morphological renal injury.\n Excess dose PSW caused transient gross renal contusion, which resolved in the majority of animals with no persistent microscopic abnormality.\n Divided excess dose PSW resulted in no gross or microscopic damage.\n High frequency PSW was associated with mild histological abnormality.\n Multiple PSW treatments caused small discrete fibrotic lesions in all cases, without any change in renal function.",
