  "text": "Nd:YAG-laser in the microsurgery of frontobasal meningiomas.\n Forty-three patients with big frontobasal meningiomas underwent a microsurgical removal of the tumor.\n The 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser has proved useful in this prospective series particularly with the contactless shrinkage of the tumors and the necrotization of the dural and bony attachments.\n Tumor shrinkage was achieved by radiating the tumor surface with the Nd:YAG-laser.\n This technique facilitated the microsurgical dissection and reduced the blood loss by half.\n The Nd:YAG-laser necrotization of the dural and bony attachments reduced the recurrence rate following grade two resections from 20% to zero.\n The postoperative quality of life was excellent with a complete rehabilitation in 76% of the patients.\n The use of the 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser improved significantly the results of microsurgery for frontobasal meningioma.",
