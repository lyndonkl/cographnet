  "text": "Argon laser stapedotomy.\n Lasers have been used in otology for 10 years.\n There have been reports of excellent hearing results using laser energy in surgery for otosclerosis.\n We used the argon laser in 75 consecutive primary stapedotomy procedures.\n The postoperative air-bone gap was 10 dB or less in 87% of patients and 20 dB or less in 95%.\n One ear (1.5%) had no postoperative hearing secondary to a granulomatous reaction.\n Complications were otherwise uncommon and mild.\n Most patients were treated on an outpatient basis.\n Our results compare favorably with other reports of laser surgery for otosclerosis.\n We conclude that excellent hearing results can be obtained using the argon laser for stapedotomy procedures.",
