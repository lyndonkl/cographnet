  "text": "Chinese-white differences in the distribution of occlusive cerebrovascular disease.\n The distribution of cerebrovascular lesions is affected by race.\n Blacks and Japanese have more intracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease, while whites have more extracranial disease.\n Despite a high incidence of stroke in China, there are few formal studies of the distribution of vascular occlusive disease in Chinese populations.\n We compared clinical and angiographic features of 24 white and 24 Chinese patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease.\n In symptomatic vascular territories, whites had more severe (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more severe intracranial lesions.\n When we counted mild and severe lesions in a symptomatic territory, whites had more extracranial lesions while Chinese had more intracranial lesions.\n When we combined symptomatic and asymptomatic territories, whites had more extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more intracranial lesions.\n White patients reported more transient ischemic attacks.\n The distribution of lesions, however, was not explained by differences in incidence of transient ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or ischemic heart disease between the groups.\n The preponderance of intracranial vascular lesions in Chinese patients is similar to that seen in blacks and Japanese.\n Racial differences in the occurrence of extracranial and intracranial lesions raise the possibility of a different underlying pathophysiology for the 2 locations.",
