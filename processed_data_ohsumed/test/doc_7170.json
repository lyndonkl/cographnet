  "text": "Psychosocial, functional, and quality of life assessment of patients with posttraumatic fracture nonunion, chronic refractory osteomyelitis, and lower extremity amputation.\n One hundred nine patients with long-bone fracture nonunion, chronic refractory osteomyelitis, or posttraumatic amputation were evaluated for the impact of chronic disability on quality of life, as measured by the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS) and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS).\n A self-administered PAIS for spouses assessed psychosocial adjustment of spouses or significant others.\n A final questionnaire ranked the reasons for either continuing medical therapy or accepting amputation.\n The PAIS scores differed significantly between osteomyelitis patients and both nonunion and amputation patients (p less than .05).\n The presence or absence of pain produced significant differences in AIMS and PAIS scores of nonunion and osteomyelitis patients (p less than .05).\n Subscale analysis of AIMS scores revealed significant differences among the three groups in health perception and scale of orthopedic problem: osteomyelitis patients were more severely affected than nonunion or amputation patients.\n The PAIS detected no statistically significant difference in psychosocial adjustment of spouses of patients in the three population groups.\n The most common reason for continuing medical and surgical management of nonunion and osteomyelitis was expectation for cure.\n The amputee group chose ablation to avoid further treatment.\n Differences in psychosocial and functional ability were related to disease diagnosis, pain, status of fracture healing, and timing of amputation.",
