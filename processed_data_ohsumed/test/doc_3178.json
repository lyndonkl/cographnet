  "text": "Effect of synchronous increase in intrathoracic pressure on cardiac performance during acute endotoxemia.\n In the anesthetized closed-chest canine model of Gram-negative endotoxemia (n = 10), we tested the hypothesis that the effect of cardiac cycle-specific intrathoracic pressure pulses delivered by a heart rate-(HR) synchronized high-frequency jet ventilator (sync HFJV) on systolic ventricular performance is dependent on the level of preload.\n To control for HFJV frequency, hemodynamic responses were also measured at fixed frequency within 15% of HR (async HFJV).\n Biventricular stroke volumes (SV) were measured by electromagnetic flow probes.\n Measurements were made before (baseline) and 30 min after infusion of 1 mg/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin (serotype 055:B5) and then after 2 mg/kg propranolol at both low (less than 10 mmHg) left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) and high (greater than 10 mmHg) LVFP.\n Ventricular function curves, aortic pressure-flow (P-Q) relationships, and venous return (VR) curves were analyzed.\n We found that endotoxin did not alter VR curves but shifted the aortic P-Q curves to the left with pressure on the x-axis (P less than 0.05).\n Volume loading increased SV (P less than 0.01) because of a rightward shift of the VR curve.\n No specific differences occurred with either sync or async HFJV during endotoxin, presumably because of preserved VR and shifted aortic P-Q.\n The lack of cardiac cycle-specific effects of ITP appears to be due to the selective endotoxin-induced changes in peripheral vasomotor tone that counterbalance any depressed myocardial contractility.",
