  "text": "Helicobacter pylori infection in pernicious anemia: a prospective controlled study.\n Although some authors believe that Helicobacter pylori is the etiologic agent in chronic nonspecific gastritis, it has also been suggested that the bacterium colonizes inflamed mucosa as a secondary event.\n This study documents the prevalence of H.\n pylori in 28 patients with pernicious anemia and compares the findings with those of a group of 28 age-, race-, and sex-matched asymptomatic control subjects.\n All subjects underwent endoscopy with biopsy of the gastric antrum and corpus.\n A sample of serum was obtained before endoscopy for determination of antibodies (immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G) to H.\n pylori.\n The prevalence of H.\n pylori (by biopsy) in patients with pernicious anemia was significantly less than that in controls (11% vs.\n 71%, P less than 0.0001).\n All patients with pernicious anemia had abnormalities of corpus histology (inflammation and/or atrophy).\n In addition, 50% of patients with pernicious anemia had a lymphocytic infiltration of the antrum.\n All controls with H.\n pylori had gastritis, 50% having active chronic gastritis.\n Atrophic changes of the corpus were more commonly found in patients with pernicious anemia (75% vs.\n 7%, P less than 0.0001).\n Serology and biopsy results correlated poorly in the patients with pernicious anemia: all 5 patients with positive serology results had negative biopsy results, whereas all 3 patients with positive cultures on biopsy had negative serological studies.\n In conclusion, patients with pernicious anemia are protected from infection with H.\n pylori, and H.\n pylori does not passively colonize mucosa inflamed by an unrelated process.",
