  "text": "Low-dose dapsone prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS and AIDS-related complex.\n The efficacy, toxicity and cost of orally administered dapsone (50-100 mg/day) for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were evaluated in 30 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC).\n Six patients received primary and 24 secondary prophylaxis.\n Ten patients received a maximum dose of 100 mg/day and 20 a maximum of 50 mg/day for a median duration of 19 weeks; 22 of the 30 patients continue to receive prophylaxis as of May 1989.\n Four patients have died, none of pneumocystis infection.\n One patient with AIDS suffered a mild relapse while receiving 50 mg/day.\n Hematologic toxicity was mild and could not be definitively attributed to dapsone therapy; rash due to dapsone was documented in two patients.\n A review of 33 patients at our institution with a history of PCP who received no prophylaxis demonstrated seven relapses, three of which were fatal.\n Cost analysis revealed a significant advantage for oral dapsone over aerosolized pentamidine.",
