  "text": "Emergency laparoscopy.\n Unnecessary abdominal explorations in severely injured patients can be reduced by employing emergent or urgent laparoscopy in blunt abdominal trauma and the obscured, acute abdominal cases.\n In 150 blunt abdominal trauma cases, a mini-laparoscopy was used in the emergency room or the intensive care unit without major complications.\n In 56%, the findings were negative.\n In 19%, the laparoscopic findings were corroborated by surgery.\n In 25%, a minimal to moderate hemoperitoneum was found and the laparoscopic impression dictated close observation.\n Unnecessary exploration was avoided except in one case.\n In the elderly high-risk patient with a poor history, abdominal examination can be noninformative.\n Laparoscopy can detect acute appendicitis or organ perforation.\n In the young female, appendicitis can be differentiated from pelvic inflammatory disease.\n Laparoscopy is more accurate and gives a larger latitude for decision-making than lavage.\n It can also be useful in the obscured problematic abdominal case.",
