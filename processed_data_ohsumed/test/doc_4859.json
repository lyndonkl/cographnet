  "text": "Prognostic factors in acute renal failure following aortic aneurysm surgery.\n This study analyses the prognostic factors associated with survival in 70 patients who developed acute renal failure following surgery for an aortic aneurysm.\n Forty-nine patients (70 per cent) had surgery for a ruptured aortic aneurysm and 21 patients (30 per cent) had an elective procedure.\n Fifty-nine patients received haemodialysis.\n Thirty-three patients (47 per cent) survived the episode of acute renal failure.\n Six of these thirty-three patients died within three months of recovering from acute renal failure, giving an overall survival of 27/70 (39 per cent).\n A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors significantly adversely affected survival: a need for inotropic support, ventilation for more than three days and age over 65 years.\n A model developed using these variables provided a basis for predicting outcome.",
