  "text": "Leiomyosarcoma of bone. A clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study of five cases.\n The authors identified five leiomyosarcomas (LMS) in a review of 13 nonmatrix-producing spindle cell sarcomas of bone.\n Only two were initially recognized as LMS; the others had been diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two) and fibrosarcoma (one).\n The patients, four of whom were women, ranged in age from 32 to 70 years.\n Sites included proximal humerus (two), distal femur (two), and rib (one).\n All tumors presented with clinical and radiographic features consistent with a diagnosis of primary bone neoplasms, although one probably represented a solitary metastasis from a primary uterine LMS.\n Radiographs showed lytic bone destruction with a moth-eaten appearance, and three cases had soft tissue extension.\n Histologically, all tumors showed broad, interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic nuclei, frequent mitoses, and necrosis.\n Two cases had a focal storiform pattern and bizarre multinucleated cells, and two other cases had focally prominent osteoclast-like giant cells.\n Extensive immunoreactivity for muscle actin was seen in all cases and for desmin in three.\n In each case, electron microscopy showed definite smooth muscle differentiation including cytoplasmic filaments with densities.\n At this writing, two patients are free of disease (including the patient with a presumed metastasis), one is alive with locally recurrent disease, and two are dead of disease.\n Experience suggests that LMS of bone is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that may be more common than previously recognized.\n Application of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to nonmatrix-producing bone sarcomas should facilitate diagnosis of additional cases.",
