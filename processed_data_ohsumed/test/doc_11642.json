  "text": "Postpartum renal failure in systemic lupus erythematosus.\n The present report describes an unusual association between postpartum renal failure and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n Two healty young women developed progressive renal failure several weeks after delivery accompanied by the presence in their serum of strongly reactive anti-nuclear antibodies and positive anti-DNA antibodies.\n In both cases kidney biopsy disclosed light and electron microscopy pictures typical of idiopathic postpartum renal failure, with multiple intravascular thrombi and no evidence of active lupus nephritis.\n Intrarenal microthrombi formation may represent a form of exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus after delivery.\n The early recognition of this syndrome may have therapeutic implications.",
