  "text": "Superficial femoral artery as inflow for bypass to the proximal popliteal artery.\n We have obtained long term follow-up on 58 patients in whom the superficial femoral artery was used as a donor site for bypass to the proximal popliteal artery.\n The indication for the reconstructive procedure was intermittent claudication 36%, rest pain 34%, and gangrene 26%.\n All patients had angiographic evidence of a patent proximal superficial femoral artery and many had relative indications for short bypass such as limited saphenous vein availability or compromised medical condition.\n There was a cumulative patency rate of 79% by life table method for the series with a six year follow-up.\n We have observed that the superficial femoral artery is a satisfactory inflow site for proximal popliteal bypass grafts in selected patients.\n The procedure can maximize use of a limited segment of vein with minimal operative time and morbidity.\n Inflow stenosis can be revised or long bypass procedures can be offered in the event of graft failure.",
