  "text": "Deficiency of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in a patient with facioscapulohumeral disease.\n Facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD), an inherited neuromuscular disorder, is characterized by progressive wasting of specific muscle groups, particularly the proximal musculature of the upper limbs; the primary defect in this disorder is unknown.\n We studied a patient with FSHD to determine whether the mitochondrial respiratory chain was functionally abnormal.\n Muscle biopsy revealed fiber atrophy with patchy staining for oxidative enzymes.\n Electron microscopy of a liver section showed many enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions.\n Decreased oxidation of the respiratory substrates-alanine and succinate-in skin fibroblasts suggested a deficiency of complex III of the electron-transport chain; cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) was in the normal range.\n Biochemical analysis of liver supported the fibroblast data, since succinate oxidase activity (electron-transport activity through complexes II-IV) was reduced, whereas complex IV activity was normal.\n Furthermore, analysis of the cytochrome spectrum in liver revealed typical peaks for cytochromes cc1 and aa3, whereas cytochrome b (a component of complex III) was undetectable.\n Southern blot analysis of fibroblast mtDNA revealed no major deletions or rearrangements.\n Our study provides the first documentation of a specific enzyme-complex deficiency associated with FSHD.",
