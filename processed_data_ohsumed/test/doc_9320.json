  "text": "Uses and complications of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.\n Uvulopalatopharygoplasty has become widely performed for chronic snoring and for cases of obstructive sleep apnoea.\n Unfortunately this operation is not without morbidity and complications.\n We report our results of a prospective series of 50 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with a minimum follow-up of one year.\n Snoring was abolished in 18 (36 per cent) and substantially reduced in the remainder.\n Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, identified in 11 patients pre-operatively, was reduced in severity in all but three.\n Troublesome complications were seen in 18 (36 per cent) patients, namely intermittent velopharyngeal incompetence in five (10 per cent), pharyngeal dryness in 11 (22 per cent) and loss of taste in five (10 per cent).\n One patient had nasopharyngeal stenosis requiring correction.\n A cautious approach to this operation is required with rigorous case selection.\n The importance of full assessment and careful follow-up should not be underestimated.",
