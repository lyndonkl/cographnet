A report from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data Bank.\n In this prospective multicenter study, the authors have examined data derived from the initial computerized tomography (CT) scans of 753 patients with severe head injury.\n When the CT findings were related to abnormal intracranial pressure and to death, the most important characteristics of the scans were: midline shift: compression or obliteration of the mesencephalic cisterns: and the presence of subarachnoid blood.\n Diffuse hemispheric swelling was also found to be associated with an early episode of either hypoxia or hypotension.",
