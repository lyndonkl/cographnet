  "text": "Augmentation mammaplasty by means of the transrectus route.\n A new operative technique has been developed for augmentation mammaplasty.\n Through an inframammary incision, the anterior rectus sheath is entered, and the pocket is dissected in an entirely submuscular plane.\n We have performed this procedure in 112 patients to date.\n Complications have been few.\n The capsular contracture rate in 90 patients followed for greater than 1 year is 7 percent.\n The inframammary crease can be lowered using this technique, making mastopexy unnecessary in most patients with moderate ptosis.",
