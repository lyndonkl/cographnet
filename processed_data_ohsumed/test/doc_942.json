  "text": "Management of dysphagia in suspected esophageal motor disorders \n Fifty-three patients suffering from dysphagia because of suspected esophageal motor disorders were treated by pneumatic dilatation using the Rider-Moeller technique.\n Fifteen had achalasia demonstrated by manometric studies.\n Forty-nine of them had remarkable clinical improvement after the procedure.\n During the mean period of follow-up (average 5 years, range 1-11), 75% of the patients needed a new dilatation, with a delay of two years.\n The results of the dilatation were excellent or good in 80% of the cases.\n Early complications consisted in two esophageal perforations surgically treated.\n There was no mortality.\n We did not observe late complications of the procedure.\n We conclude that pneumatic dilatation should be the initial procedure in the treatment of dysphagia in suspected esophageal motor disorders.",
