  "text": "Unusual presentation of recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis.\n A 65-year-old woman presented with recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis following two years of immunosuppressive therapy and three years of complete remission.\n At her initial presentation, she had a characteristic x-ray picture showing multiple nodules with total resolution of these findings at three months.\n Five years later, at the time of clinical relapse, her chest x-ray film showed bilateral diffuse infiltrative disease.\n This change in radiologic presentation upon relapse of Wegener's has not previously been reported.\n Other unusual features include diffuse infiltrates as the pulmonary presentation and the long interval between cessation of therapy and relapse.\n We review the radiologic manifestations of Wegener's granulomatosis.",
