  "text": "Pediatric testicular tumors: the Johns Hopkins experience.\n Testicular neoplasms constitute 1 percent of all childhood malignancies and rank eighth in childhood cancer mortality.\n From 1970 to 1988, 25 testicular tumors in children eighteen years and under were seen.\n The majority of the patients were white (88%).\n Pathologic analysis of the tumors revealed that 68 percent were germinal and 32 percent were nongerminal.\n Staging was undertaken in all patients with serum markers, chest x-ray film, and computerized tomography scans or lymphangiography.\n All patients underwent radical orchiectomy, and further therapy was given dependent on tumor type and stage.\n The survival among this cohort was excellent, with only 3 patients succumbing to their disease.\n Detailed results of treatment, and approaches to avoid excess treatment morbidity are reviewed.",
