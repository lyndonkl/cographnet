  "text": "Hyposomatomedinemia in men with post-poliomyelitis syndrome.\n The age of onset of the post-poliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) coincides with the tendency for declining activity of the growth hormone/somatomedin C (GH/SmC) axis.\n The normal plasma SmC range in men before the age of 40 is 0.50 to 1.50 units/mL.\n After age 40 about 30% of men have a plasma SmC level below 0.35 units/mL, signifying no detectable spontaneous GH secretory pulses.\n Because the GH/SmC axis stimulates DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in muscle cells and increases their size and number, a deficiency of the GH/SmC axis could theoretically contribute as a secondary factor to the occurrence or severity of the PPS.\n Accordingly, the authors measured the plasma SmC level in 10 men with PPS, ages 35 to 63, and in 94 healthy men of similar age.\n In the PPS men, 100% of the values were less than or equal to 0.40 units/mL, and 90% were less than or equal to 0.35 units/mL.\n The corresponding proportions in the healthy men were 40% and 27%.\n Analysis of variance including age as a factor showed SmC to be significantly lower in the PPS men than in the healthy men.\n In an additional comparison, totally immobile nursing home men did not have lowered SmC values.\n In fact their SmC values were slightly higher than those of healthy men of similar age.\n The data revealed a new biochemical feature of PPS, hyposomatomedinemia, which might play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome.",
