  "text": "Growth hormone for short stature not due to classic growth hormone deficiency.\n The advent of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in potentially unlimited supplies of growth hormone.\n Sufficient quantities are now available not only for the long-term, uninterrupted treatment of GH-deficient children but potentially for the treatment of non-GH-deficient patients with other short stature or growth attenuating disorders.\n Short-term studies have demonstrated an improvement in the growth rates of subjects with isolated short stature, Turner syndrome, and chronic renal failure; and additional studies are under way to assess the efficacy of GH therapy of other short stature syndromes.\n However, the long-term efficacy and possible adverse effects of GH treatment in these situations is not known.\n Until there has been more experience, GH deficiency should remain the primary indication for GH treatment.\n Growth hormone should not be considered routine therapy for other conditions associated with or resulting in short stature.\n However, research should continue in these areas to define which children may benefit from GH treatment.",
