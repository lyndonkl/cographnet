  "text": "The prophylactic use of antibiotic impregnated beads in open fractures.\n Four hundred four compound fractures were reviewed in 339 patients treated between August 1983 and November 1987.\n The 252 males and 87 females had a mean age of 33 years (range, 14-86).\n One hundred twenty-seven (31.4%) fractures were classified as Grade I, 153 (38.9%) as Grade II, and 124 (30.7%) as Grade III by Gustilo's classification.\n The mean Injury Severity Score was 15 (range, 9-57).\n Three hundred thirty-four of the open fractures (82.7%) were managed with antibiotic-impregnated bead chains (tobramycin) and systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (cefazolin, tobramycin, and penicillin).\n Seventy open fractures (17.3%) received systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (cefazolin, tobramycin, and penicillin) without supplemental use of the antibiotic beads.\n All open fractures underwent acute irrigation and debridement.\n In the 404 fractures 46.5% of wounds were closed primarily, 12.9% underwent delayed primary closure, 7.9% were left open, and 32.7% were temporized by the antibiotic bead pouch technique until definitive flap coverage and skin grafting were performed.\n Of the 404 fractures evaluated, 17 (4.2%) developed an acute wound infection.\n Of these wound infections, eight (11.4%) were in the group managed with systemic antibiotics alone.\n By comparison, nine (2.7%) of open fractures treated with combined systemic antibiotics and antibiotic-impregnated beads developed an infection.\n Chronic osteomyelitis developed in 18 of 404 open fractures (4.5%).\n Ten (14.3%) open fractures which developed osteomyelitis were managed with systemic antibiotics whereas eight (2.4%) fractures managed with systemic antibiotics and antibiotic-impregnated beads developed a chronic infection.",
