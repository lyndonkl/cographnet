  "text": "Full-thickness skin graft vaginoplasty for treatment of the stenotic or foreshortened vagina.\n Vaginal stenosis or foreshortening following surgery or radiation therapy can lead to dyspareunia.\n This report concerns the successful use of full-thickness skin grafts taken from the flank overlying the iliac crest to treat vaginal stenosis or foreshortening.\n The operation consists of incising the involved area and creating a space which will become the recipient site.\n An elliptical piece of full-thickness skin harvested from the area overlying the iliac crest is cleared of underlying fat, trimmed to fit the recipient site, and sutured in place.\n Vaginal packing is used to keep the graft against the recipient bed.\n Ten patients have been treated successfully with this technique, without significant complications or sequelae.\n Follow-up from 6 weeks to 42 months showed excellent postsurgical vaginal capacity in all patients.\n Similarly, excellent functional results were achieved in eight patients, with distinct improvement in the remaining two.\n This procedure is a useful addition to the gynecologic surgeon's armamentarium.",
