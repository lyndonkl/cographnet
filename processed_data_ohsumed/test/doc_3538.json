  "text": "Rectovulvar fistula in a child secondary to an unusual foreign body.\n Foreign bodies in the female genital tract are well recognized as a cause of pain, discharge, secretions, and infection.\n In the small child, the presence of a vaginal discharge is usually associated with either a common object which has been inserted or sexual abuse complicated by a sexually transmitted disease.\n A 3-year-old child presented with a recurrent labial secretion and drainage due to an unusual foreign body.\n It was only during a second operation that the possibility of a foreign body was entertained, and diagnostic testing was begun.\n A third operation permitted removal of the foreign body, a large bone probably of animal origin.\n The fistula tract was closed after a colostomy was performed.\n This represents the first reported case of a rectovulvar fistula not of a congenital nature.",
