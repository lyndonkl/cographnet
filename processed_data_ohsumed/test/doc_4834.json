  "text": "Abdominal wall considerations and complications in reoperative surgery.\n The abdominal wall is the source of significant problems for patients undergoing multiple abdominal operations.\n The orientation of sequential incisions must be carefully considered to avoid compromise of the abdominal wall blood supply, which may result in either acute (dehiscence) or delayed (ventral hernia) complications.\n Infections are the most serious problems of the multiply operated on abdominal wall.\n These complications may range from simple wound infection to necrotizing fasciitis.\n Management may require only simple drainage of the infection or may entail extensive debridement for the necrotizing processes.\n Regardless of the cause, the multiply operated on abdominal wall may require reconstruction because of lost fascia.\n Polypropylene mesh can be employed safely and effectively for this purpose.",
