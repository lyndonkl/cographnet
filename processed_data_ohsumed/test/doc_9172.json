  "text": "Definition of the role of contemporary surgical management in cisternal and parenchymatous cysticercosis cerebri.\n With increasing immigration from endemic regions, the incidence of neurocysticercosis in North America is rising.\n This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the role of surgery in those cases presenting with large cystic parenchymal and cisternal lesions in the current era of anthelminthic agents administered orally.\n A total of 237 patients presented with newly diagnosed neurocysticercosis to our institution over a recent 5-year period (mean age, 31.2 years).\n Among those who presented with cystic mass lesions predominantly affecting the brain parenchyma and cisternal spaces, 20 (8.4%; mean age, 40.2 years) with large cystic lesions subsequently underwent surgical intervention, either because of an emergent presentation or because they were refractory to medical management.\n Clinical presentation included increased intracranial pressure, focal neurological deficit, and seizure.\n Radiographic imaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) demonstrated 12 cases with cisternal lesions, 7 with parenchymal lesions, and 1 involving both compartments.\n Based on imaging guidelines, 30 operative procedures (excluding shunt revisions) were performed (14 craniotomies, 8 cerebrospinal fluid diversions, 7 stereotactic procedures, and 1 burr hole drainage).\n Fifteen (75%) showed neurological or symptomatic improvement over a median follow-up period of 36.4 months.\n There were three surgery-related complications and no deaths.",
