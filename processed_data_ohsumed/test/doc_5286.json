  "text": "Decompensation after Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation of idiopathic scoliosis.\n Spinal decompensation after corrective surgery for scoliosis appears to be a significant problem after Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation (CDI).\n CDI produces torsional changes in the instrumented and uninstrumented spine that could result in spinal imbalance.\n Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional analysis including computed tomography (CT) scans to measure vertebral rotation and segmental rotation were performed to evaluate the importance of torsional changes.\n Moe/King Type II deformities had a substantially greater risk of imbalance.\n Deformities instrumented over fewer spinal segments were less likely to decompensate.\n Specifically, instrumentation excluding the mobile transition segment, determined by maximum segmental rotation and segmental Cobb angle, was likely to decompensate.\n Derotation and deformity correction excessive in relation to preoperative side bending flexibility and segmental rotation frequently resulted in imbalance.\n Spinal imbalance after CDI can be reduced by avoiding overcorrection and inclusion of mobile transition segments.",
