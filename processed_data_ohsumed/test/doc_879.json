  "text": "Duodenal stricture: a complication of chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis.\n Over the past 10 years, one of us (M.C.A.) has treated 92 patients who required operation for symptoms associated with alcohol-induced chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis.\n Four of these patients had duodenal obstruction.\n All four had had lateral pancreaticojejunostomy to relieve pancreatic ductal obstruction and associated chronic abdominal pain; three of the four also required biliary diversion for stenosis of the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct.\n Each duodenal stricture required reoperation and gastrojejunostomy to bypass the site of obstruction.\n A review of the English language literature revealed that duodenal obstruction in patients with chronic fibrocalcific pancreatitis is uncommon, only 58 previous cases having been reported.\n All of those patients had pancreatic ductal obstruction, and more than half had concomitant distal biliary stenosis.\n Two thirds of the duodenal obstructions were treated by gastroenterostomy, and one third were resected.\n Duodenal obstruction in patients with chronic pancreatitis and biliary stricture appears to reflect an advanced form of the disease.\n Combined lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and biliary diversion has emerged as the preferred surgical procedure for this problem.\n Careful preoperative assessment for evidence of duodenal stenosis also is needed in this group of patients, and gastroenterostomy is indicated in appropriate cases.",
