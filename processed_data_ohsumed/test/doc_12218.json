  "text": "AIDS and adolescents. How can you help them reduce their risk?\n AIDS in adolescents (0.4% of all cases) is a problem of increasing importance in the United States.\n Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exists in high schools and on university campuses, and it presents a real and immediate threat to teenaged Americans who engage in drug abuse and sexual activity.\n Appropriately targeted educational efforts are needed to limit HIV transmission among adolescents.\n Most adolescents are aware of the high-risk activities that may lead to HIV transmission.\n However, only about one third alter their sexual behavior to avoid AIDS.\n It is important to move beyond imparting knowledge about AIDS transmission and to move toward changing risky behavior.\n Strategies for AIDS risk reduction in adolescents should be implemented now across the country.\n Appropriate support and intervention are urgently needed for adolescents at high risk.",
