  "text": "Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of a single dose of ornidazole (1,000 milligrams intravenously) for antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.\n Levels in serum and tissue penetration of ornidazole were studied after a single intravenous injection of 1,000 mg given to 14 patients for prophylaxis of surgical infection.\n They were scheduled for elective colorectal surgery.\n Adequate levels in blood (greater than or equal to MIC for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested) were found in all patients throughout the procedure and up to hour 24.\n Mean-maximal (15 min) and last-determined (24 h) ornidazole levels in serum were 24 +/- 5.2 and 6.3 +/- 1.4 mg/liter, respectively.\n beta-Phase elimination half-life was 14.1 +/- 2.7 h, and clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 47 +/- 12 ml/min and 0.9 +/- 0.13 liters/kg, respectively.\n In all patient, adequate levels in tissue were found in the abdominal wall and the epiploic fat at time of incision and in the colonic wall at time of anastomosis.\n At time of closure, all but one patient had adequate levels in tissue in the abdominal wall and the epiploic fat.\n No anaerobic nor aerobic infection occurred in the study patients.",
