  "text": "Alkaline reflux gastritis.\n Alkaline reflux gastritis and the symptoms associated with alkaline reflux gastritis have been reported in the medical literature since shortly after Billroth successfully performed his first gastrectomy in the 1880s.\n The disease process is produced by, or at least is associated with, the reflux of alkaline secretions into the gastric remnant.\n Although it occurs after any procedure that ablates the pylorus including pyloroplasty, it would appear to be most common after a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy.\n How the alkaline secretions cause the gastritis is still controversial.\n Clearly, the most effective therapy is to reroute the secretions from the biliary tract, pancreas, and duodenum so that they will not reflux into the gastric remnant.\n This is most effectively accomplished by a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with the afferent limb measuring at least 18 inches (40 cm).\n The surgeon and the patient should be aware that the construction of such a gastric outlet channel is associated with delayed gastric emptying.\n The etiology of this impaired emptying is also controversial.\n If the patient has symptoms of dumping (either early or late), these symptoms may also be abated using the Roux limb.\n At least 40% of patients will have gastric outlet obstruction.\n Supportive therapy is appropriate in the majority of these patients.",
