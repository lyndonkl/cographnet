  "text": "Acinic cell carcinoma. Clinicopathologic review.\n The authors reviewed 90 cases of acinic cell carcinoma treated at the Mayo Clinic to assess long-term follow-up and to study features predictive of disease progression.\n Sixty-three patients (55 females and 35 males) were seen for primary treatment; 27 had recurrent disease when first evaluated.\n Histologically, these tumors were composed of serous acinar cells and intercalated duct-type cells.\n Morphologic patterns included solid, microcystic, follicular, and papillary-cystic.\n All patients were followed for at least 10 years or until death.\n Of the primary treatment group, 44% had local recurrence, 19% had metastasis, and 25% died of disease.\n Disease first recurred locally up to 30 years after presentation and resulted in death after as many as 38 years.\n Poor prognostic features include pain or fixation; gross invasion; microscopic features of desmoplasia, atypia, or increased mitotic activity; and excision as initial treatment.\n Neither morphologic pattern nor cell composition was a predictive feature.",
