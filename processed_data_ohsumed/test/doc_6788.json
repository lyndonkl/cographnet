  "text": "Prognostic indicators of the resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survival of the fetus.\n To delineate any possible prognostic indicators, we reviewed the ultrasonographic and nonmorphometric findings in 19 antenatally diagnosed cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis in which it was chosen to continue the pregnancy.\n Thirteen fetuses died and six survived.\n Of all parameters examined, including associated anomalies, abnormal karyotype, location of serous fluid, anemia, and possible cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis, the most sensitive prognostic indicator was the real-time-directed M-mode echocardiographic measurement of the biventricular outer dimension in diastole.\n All fetuses with biventricular outer dimensions greater than 95% died, whereas all but one with normal biventricular outer dimensions had resolution of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and survived.\n This was highly significant (p less than 0.001) with the predictive value of a normal biventricular outer dimension being 86% and the predictive value of an enlarged biventricular outer dimension being 100%.",
