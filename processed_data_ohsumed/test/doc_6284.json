  "text": "EEG correlation of improvement in hemolytic-uremic syndrome after plasma infusion.\n We report a previously undescribed electroencephalographic pattern of epochs of diffuse delta background (85-240 sec) alternating with epochs of classic \"burst suppression\" (90-270 sec) in a 13-month-old girl with hemolytic-uremic syndrome.\n A dramatic electroencephalographic improvement was evident on continuous monitoring of cerebral function 3 hours after initiating fresh frozen plasma infusion, well before any clinical improvement was apparent.\n This patient, in addition to the unusual electroencephalographic findings, illustrates the role of continuous electrophysiologic monitoring of cerebral function and supports the use of fresh frozen plasma in hemolytic-uremic syndrome.",
