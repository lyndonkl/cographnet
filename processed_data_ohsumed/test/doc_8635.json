  "text": "Treatment of adenocarcinoma of the cardia with synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n Twenty-nine evaluable patients with adenocarcinoma of the cardia were treated with synchronously administered chemotherapy (two cycles of 5-fluouracil and cisplatin and 30-36 Gy of radiation to determine whether these tumours are responsive to such treatment.\n Complete regression of tumour was observed endoscopically in 19 patients, and partial regression in four.\n Fourteen patients had their tumours resected and in six no microscopic tumour was found in the specimen.\n Nine patients received additional radiotherapy to a total dose of 54-60 Gy instead of surgery.\n Tumour response was associated with rapid reversal of dysphagia.\n Only one patient required subsequent intervention for relief of dysphagia due to fibrous stricture.\n Enhanced survival was associated with a complete endoscopic response to initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a tumour of less than 5 cm in length.\n The median survival of responding patients was 15 months.\n Synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy was of major palliative benefit in this series and merits further evaluation.",
