  "text": "Retro-orbicularis oculus fat (ROOF) resection in aesthetic blepharoplasty: a 6-year study in 63 patients \n Sixty-three nonconsecutive patients have undergone resection of the retro-orbicularis oculus fat (ROOF) in conjunction with aesthetic blepharoplasty.\n In these patients, a consistent and useful ability to soften and flatten heaviness and bulkiness in the lateral upper orbital region was seen.\n Two patients developed postoperative hematoma, and two different patients had transient dry-eye symptoms following blepharoplasty.\n Twenty percent of patients had a transient degree of numbness in the lateral supraorbital nerve region, and all patients noted some transient numbness over the lateral upper brow region.\n No patient demonstrated significant paralysis of the orbicularis oculus or corrugator muscle.\n From this experience, retro-orbicularis oculus fat resection would appear to be a useful adjunct to standard blepharoplasty techniques in selected patients.",
