  "text": "Instillation of vancomycin into a cerebrospinal fluid reservoir to clear infection: pharmacokinetic considerations.\n Vancomycin instilled in an Ommaya reservoir was used to treat a reservoir-associated infection.\n Vancomycin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured, and derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters allowed tailoring of dosing.\n First-order kinetics were observed.\n The calculated half-life of 3.52 h was less than reported by others, and the apparent volume of distribution (60 ml) was less than anticipated.\n The elimination constant was 0.197 h-1.\n Empiric dosing based on schedules suggested in the literature would have led to high peak and low mean concentrations of intrareservoir vancomycin.\n Patients with reservoir-associated infections have a variety of pathophysiologic conditions that can result in alteration of normal CSF dynamics.\n Pharmacokinetic analysis is useful to individualize dosing and to optimize therapy with intrareservoir vancomycin.",
