  "text": "Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction.\n Progressive dysphagia is common in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma.\n Multiple nonsurgical techniques are available to provide palliation and improved nutrition.\n Simple dilatation is the oldest technique and newer methods may offer greater efficacy.\n Laser therapy now provides an excellent opportunity to treat obstructing tumors.\n Placement of an esophageal prosthesis may become particularly useful when dilatation must be performed too frequently or has become ineffective or in the patient with an esophageal-pulmonary fistula.\n Newer techniques including BICAP tumor probe, intracavitary radiotherapy, or absolute alcohol injection offer promise.\n This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these different palliative techniques for patients with the extremely poor prognosis associated with esophageal cancer.",
