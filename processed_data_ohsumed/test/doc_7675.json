  "text": "Prognostic factors for outcome of and survival after second-look laparotomy in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma.\n In ovarian cancer stages IIB-IV, pre-treatment variables and variables obtained intraoperatively at second-look laparotomy were investigated for their prognostic influence on the outcome of 109 patients and survival after second-look laparotomy in 131 patients.\n The subjects came from a randomized trial of sequential versus alternating combination chemotherapy.\n The overall median survival after second-look laparotomy was 62 months.\n Logistic regression analysis identified stage and hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy as significant prognostic covariates for second-look laparotomy outcome.\n Based on a Cox multivariate stepwise analysis, independent prognostic factors for survival after second-look laparotomy were secondary residual tumor size, pre-treatment histologic differentiation grade, and performance status.\n A high differentiation grade and a good performance status at the start of therapy thus still had a prolonging effect on survival after second-look laparotomy.\n The prognostic power of these pre-treatment variables was increased substantially by the addition of the secondary residual tumor size variable.\n The 3-year survival rate after second-look laparotomy for high- and low-risk patients was 15 and 87%, respectively.\n Second-look laparotomy thus provides prognostic information in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma, but the benefit in terms of survival is still unclear.",
