  "text": "Mammography and early breast cancer detection.\n Screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality.\n Both film-screen mammography and xeromammography are highly sensitive and specific.\n Mammography accreditation programs assure physicians and patients that a facility provides mammography of the highest quality, using the lowest possible radiation dose.\n Mammographic signs of early cancer include a small mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and a neodensity.\n Dense tissue may result in a false-negative examination even when a cancer is palpable, with adverse effects if biopsy is delayed.",
