  "text": "The Los Angeles experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n Surgeons should be competent in diagnostic laparoscopy before performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).\n Well-structured and endorsed courses with experienced faculty are important.\n Within 12 months, 418 LCs were performed in our hospital.\n The number of open cholecystectomies decreased to one third of all cholecystectomies performed.\n Cholangiography was attempted routinely and the duct was successfully cannulated in 90%.\n Inquiries were made at 6 other hospitals within a 5-mile radius where a total of 220 LCs were performed.\n The following gray areas need to be addressed: patients with slightly increased liver function tests but no jaundice, and unsuspected stones discovered by cholangiography.\n New projects are in progress to explore the common bile duct via the cystic duct or directly through the common bile duct with insertion of a T tube.\n The authors recommend proper training as well as caution and sound judgment before commencing with LC.",
