  "text": "The use of knee braces during rehabilitation.\n This article has profiled the use of knee braces as an augmentation to the overall rehabilitation program following knee injury.\n It has also outlined other aspects of rehabilitation, the use of continuous passive motion devices, and other forms of exercises and training that, together with bracing, may enhance patient recovery.\n Continuous passive motion devices have been used for many different orthopedic problems with good success.\n Understanding the mechanics of how these devices move the knee and the forces that can be applied to the knee is helpful in deciding on their use after ligamentous reconstructions.\n Rehabilitation of the knee following surgery requires a good understanding of the effects that each exercise has on the knee and the reconstruction.\n Gradual progression of exercises to the knee following knee ligament reconstruction will not overstress healing tissues.\n Many different types of knee braces exist, and careful evaluation of them may enhance patient recovery.",
