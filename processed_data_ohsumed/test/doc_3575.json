  "text": "Preventing group B streptococcal infection in newborns.\n Group B streptococci, commonly found in the maternal gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, can be transmitted to the neonate at the time of rupture of membranes and during delivery.\n Current management strategies include early detection of group B streptococcal carriers and the administration of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics to prevent maternal fetal transmission.\n Several tests are now available to rapidly identify group B streptococcal carriers.\n Physicians should be able to recognize patients at high risk for colonization and the situations in which prophylactic antibiotics should be employed.\n Proper use of antibiotics during labor can eliminate group B streptococcal sepsis in neonates.\n Early group B streptococcal meningitis carries a mortality rate of almost 50 percent, despite medical support from neonatal intensive care units.",
