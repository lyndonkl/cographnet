  "text": "A 27-year experience with splenectomy for Gaucher's disease.\n Gaucher's disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by the defective activity of acid beta-glucosidase and the resultant accumulation of glucosyl ceramide-laden macrophages in the liver, bone, and spleen.\n Splenectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease who develop massive splenomegaly with accompanying hypersplenism and/or mechanical pressure symptoms.\n The charts of 48 patients with Gaucher's disease undergoing splenectomy at our institution between January 1963 and December 1989 were analyzed to determine the short- and long-term results of this procedure.\n Thirty-five (73%) patients had total splenectomy, whereas 13 (27%) patients had partial splenectomy.\n There was one postoperative death (after total splenectomy), and 13 patients (27%) had postoperative complications.\n Eleven patients (23%) presented with accelerated bone disease after total splenectomy (mean follow-up: 96 months).\n No patients having partial splenectomy (mean follow-up: 25 months) developed progressive bone disease.\n Eight patients have died since surgery.\n All four deaths due to malignant disease occurred in patients after total splenectomy.\n The results of this largest-ever reported series of splenectomy for Gaucher's disease confirm that while either total or partial splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality, total splenectomy is accompanied by more aggressive bone disease and a predisposition to malignancy.\n Prospective, randomized trials are needed to substantiate whether partial splenectomy is indeed the treatment of choice for splenomegaly associated with Gaucher's disease.",
