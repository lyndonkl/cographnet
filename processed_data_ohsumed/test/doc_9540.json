  "text": "Long-term follow-up review of 31 children with severe closed head trauma.\n Thirty-one children aged 3 to 15 years were followed for 5 to 11 years after suffering severe closed head trauma which caused coma for 1 week or more (median duration of coma 3 weeks).\n One patient remained in a persistent vegetative state until his death 9 years later.\n The other 30 recovered consciousness and were discharged.\n All suffered diminution of their abilities, and 24 of them had major permanent disability.\n The most common motor disabilities were pure spastic hemiparesis (seven cases), basal ganglia syndromes (four cases), ataxia (three cases), and a combination of hemiparesis and ataxia (five cases).\n Of the 30 patients, 26 regained independent ambulation, seven were epileptic, and 14 were dysarthric in various degrees.\n Only 10 had the cognitive ability to profit from the normal educational system, and none had attempted postsecondary education.\n Social problems were common.\n The worst outcomes were associated with intracranial bleeding and/or brain contusion seen on computerized tomography (CT) scans at the acute stage; the best were associated with normal CT scans.\n The degree of residual disability in these children seems no less than that of adults with trauma of similar severity.",
