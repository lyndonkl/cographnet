  "text": "Bad advice; bad burn: a new problem in burn prevention.\n Deep partial-thickness burns had been inflicted on the perineal area of an infant who was recently treated in our Burn Center.\n The burns were a result of advice to the patient's mother by a pediatrician.\n The doctor told her to use a hair dryer to prevent diaper rash.\n We surveyed pediatricians, well-baby clinics, and pediatric nurse practitioners in our area and found that approximately half of them advised the use of hair dryers to treat or prevent diaper rash.\n We tested four widely available hand-held hair dryers to determine potential for inflicting burn injury.\n All of the dryers are capable of delivering air heated to at least 53 degrees C after 2 minutes of use.\n We believe that warnings against the use of hair dryers for perineal hygiene should be included in burn prevention programs.",
