  "text": "Retained intrahepatic stones: treatment with piezoelectric lithotripsy combined with stone extraction.\n Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed in 11 patients with oriental cholangiohepatitis and intrahepatic stones associated with segmented strictures of intrahepatic ducts.\n All patients had previously undergone biliary surgery and basket extraction via a T-tube tract at the time of lithotripsy.\n The indication for ESWL was failure of, or anticipated difficulty with, basket extraction of the stones via a T-tube tract.\n A piezoelectric lithotriptor was used in all procedures.\n The average total number of shock waves administered was 29,756 (range, 10,000-61,395).\n The average number of treatment sessions was 3.1 (range, 1-6); the number of shock waves used in a single session ranged from 10,000 to 15,000 with a frequency of five shots per second and 30%-50% power.\n In six patients, the stones were successfully fragmented and completely removed; in three of the others of the stones were fragmented and removed.\n The overall success rate, including complete (54%) and incomplete (27%) success, was 82%.\n Difficulty in targeting stones, and severe strictures and deformities of intrahepatic ducts, were the factors responsible for failure.\n No significant complications were observed.",
