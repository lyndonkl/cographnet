  "text": "Gallbladder perforation and bile leakage: percutaneous treatment.\n Three patients with spontaneous gallbladder perforation and one with an iatrogenic bile leak causing bile peritonitis were treated successfully by means of percutaneous catheter drainage.\n Three patients had cholelithiasis as the cause of perforation; the fourth patient had previously undergone gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether lavage and developed bile peritonitis a few hours after removal of the catheter.\n In three patients, a percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter provided successful decompression; in the fourth patient, drainage was performed with a percutaneous sump catheter in the subhepatic space adjacent to the gallbladder.\n No specific complications occurred.\n Follow-up was performed at 1, 12, 22, and 59 months, respectively.\n To date, one of the four patients has undergone elective cholecystectomy (1 month after drainage).\n The remainder of the patients are asymptomatic.\n This preliminary experience suggests that the severe complication of gallbladder perforation and bile leakage may be treated, at least temporarily, by means of percutaneous drainage.",
