  "text": "Allograft reconstructions of the shoulder after bone tumor resections.\n Large skeletal defects resulting from tumor resections about the shoulder create reconstructive challenges for the orthopedic surgeon.\n Bone allografts offer several advantages compared with other reconstructive techniques, and functional outcomes are generally satisfactory.\n They may be used either as osteoarticular grafts, intercalated segments to create an arthrodesis, or in combination with standard proximal humerus metallic implants.\n Patient expectations and specific oncologic factors must be considered when selecting the optimal method of reconstruction.",
