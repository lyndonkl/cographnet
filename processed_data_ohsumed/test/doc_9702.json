  "text": "Persistent neutrophilic meningitis.\n Persistent neutrophilic meningitis is an unusual but distinct clinical variant of chronic meningitis characterized by CSF neutrophilia with hypoglycorrhachia which persists for more than 1 week on serial CSF studies.\n Documented etiologies include selected bacteria and higher bacteria such as Brucella, Nocardia and Actinomyces as well as \"opportunistic\" fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, the Zygomycetes, and Pseudallescheria.\n Recognition of the syndrome is important, as empiric therapy (e.g., cotrimoxazole and amphotericin B) may differ significantly from that used for classic chronic meningitis.",
