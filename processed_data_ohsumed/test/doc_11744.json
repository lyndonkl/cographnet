  "text": "Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus among Egyptian children.\n A prospective analysis of 30 Egyptian children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was conducted throughout a 3 year period.\n The average followup period was 13 months.\n The age of onset ranged from 8 to 14 years.\n Most cases presented with more than one of the classical features of the disease.\n However, 23.3% presented primarily with major organ involvement.\n One case presenting with cardiac tamponade is reported in our series.\n The clinical and laboratory manifestations of the disease are presented, though more complete studies are required to confirm any possible differences in these disease manifestations compared with those found in other populations.\n Contrary to the frequently held view, our results suggest that childhood onset SLE is not rare in Africa or at least some parts of the continent.",
