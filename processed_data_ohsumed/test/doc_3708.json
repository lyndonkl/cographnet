  "text": "Gentamicin iontophoresis in the treatment of bacterial otitis externa in the guinea pig model.\n Pseudomonas otitis externa is one of the most common infections treated by otolaryngologists.\n Infections induced in 30 guinea pigs appeared similar to that seen in humans.\n The ears were then placed into four treatment groups: group A, which received a single cleaning; group B, which received a single cleaning followed by gentamicin drops 4 times daily; group C, which received a single cleaning followed by a single gentamicin iontophoresis treatment; and group D, the control group, which received no treatment.\n Infections were analyzed by grading edema, purulence, and erythema.\n An average of 10.2 days was required for control group to return to normal appearance.\n Groups A, B, and C had mean resolution times of 5.9, 4.7, and 4.3 days, respectively.\n Gentamicin iontophoresis appears to be promising, with results as good as drop therapy in otitis externa in the guinea pig model.",
