  "text": "Polyurethane foam-covered implants and capsular contracture: a laboratory investigation.\n Experiments were conducted in rabbits comparing polyurethane foam-covered implants with otherwise identical smooth silicone gel implants.\n Using five objective methods of measurement of capsular contracture, no significant difference could be identified.\n The foam-covered implants consistently developed capsular contracture, although in most cases this was of mild degree and would not have been clinically significant.\n In the two foam-covered implants with hard contractures, there was no evidence of hematoma or separation of the foam.",
