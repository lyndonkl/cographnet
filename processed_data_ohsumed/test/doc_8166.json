  "text": "Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease.\n We describe a case of inflammatory brachial plexopathy that occurred in the context of a mild, diffuse sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's disease.\n Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer.\n Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient.\n We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease.",
