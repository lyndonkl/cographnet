  "text": "Lumbosacral evoked potentials and vesicourethral function in patients with chronic suprasacral spinal cord injury.\n Persistent detrusor acontractility despite normal somatic reflex activity in some patients with high spinal cord injury is an enigma.\n Previous work has suggested disordered integration of afferent activity in sacral roots or the sacral spinal cord.\n Forty male patients with chronic stable suprasacral cord lesions were studied by filling and voiding videocystometrography, and recording lumbosacral evoked potentials from posterior tibial nerve stimulation.\n Only five of 15 patients with decreased detrusor contractility had abnormal lumbosacral evoked potentials.\n Similar abnormalities were found in four of 11 patients with efficient hyperreflexic bladders.\n The finding of normal lumbosacral evoked potentials in the majority of patients with suprasacral cord injuries and decreased detrusor contractility supports the argument that the pathophysiology of this specific form of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is multifactorial.",
