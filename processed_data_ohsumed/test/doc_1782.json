  "text": "Topical cyclosporine for oral mucosal disorders.\n Topical cyclosporine may be effective in the treatment of various oral mucosal disorders.\n In three open trials and in one double-blind study, a topical formulation of this drug produced significant improvement in oral lichen planus.\n Cyclosporine blood levels were generally low in these studies and no abnormalities of laboratory values resulted during use.\n Of six patients with oral bullous diseases treated with topical cyclosporine, four showed a decrease in erythema, partial healing of ulcerations, and a reduction in pain.\n Three patients relapsed shortly after cyclosporine was discontinued.\n Four of eight patients with persistent aphthous stomatitis remained virtually free of ulcers during 8 weeks of topical cyclosporine therapy.\n These results indicate that topical cyclosporine is beneficial as a therapy for oral lichen planus and possibly other mucosal diseases.",
