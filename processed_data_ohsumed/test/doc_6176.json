  "text": "Techniques in endoscopic lithotripsy using pulsed dye laser.\n The pulsed dye laser represents a new tool in the treatment of ureteral calculi.\n Laser energy channeled through a delicate optical fiber is used to disimpact and fragment calculi.\n Standard ureteroscopic instruments including graspers, baskets and dilatation balloons can be used with the laser system.\n Interchangeable optical fibers ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers deliver up to 120 mJ of energy to the stone's surface.\n For two weeks in 1989 an endourology clinic was held in upper Egypt.\n Eighty patients ranging in age from nine years to sixty-seven years old were evaluated and treated endoscopically.\n Endoscopes ranging from 6.9F to 12.5F were used to deliver the optical fiber.\n All stones visualized endoscopically were fragmented.\n Greater than 60 percent of the stones fragmented were composed of pure calcium oxalate monohydrate.\n Schistosoma hematobium was endemic among our study group.\n Bilharzial strictures of the distal ureter were noted in 30 percent of these patients.\n Treatment of these strictures using both balloon dilatation and graduated Teflon dilators is reviewed.\n Techniques in treating different types of ureteral calculi were explored.\n Large calcium oxalate dihydrate stones were treated most efficiently with the 3-point fragmentation technique.\n The shear off-center technique was used for the calcium oxalate monohydrate calculi.\n Variations in total energy delivered and frequency of pulsation allowed for prompt stone disimpaction as well as prevention of retrograde fragment migration.\n Concurrent use of stone baskets and graspers with the pulsed dye laser was explored.",
