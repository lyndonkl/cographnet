  "text": "Microdrill versus perforator for stapedotomy.\n The purpose of this study was to compare the hearing results of performing stapedotomy using either a microdrill or a perforator.\n Two groups of patients, otherwise similar, were followed up for at least 2 years after the stapedotomy.\n It was possible to create 0.8 mm fenestra in 91.6% of our patients.\n There was no significant difference between the two groups in hearing results.\n The results showed a continuous improvement in the first 6 post-operative months after which the hearing stabilized.\n In our hands, the microdrill has not proved to be more traumatic than the perforator to the inner ear.",
