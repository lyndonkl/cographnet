  "text": "Radical intracapsular removal of acoustic neurinomas. Long-term follow-up review of 11 patients.\n Historically, the neurosurgical treatment of large acoustic neurinomas has developed with two principal goals: complete tumor removal and preservation of facial nerve function.\n A recent goal for small tumors is the preservation of hearing.\n Out of a personal series of 124 acoustic neurinomas treated over the past 35 years, the senior author has undertaken a radical intracapsular approach in 12 patients with large tumors (greater than 3 cm in diameter).\n Surgical indications for intracapsular removal included advanced age (five cases), the patient's wish to avoid any risk of facial paralysis (six cases), contralateral facial palsy (one case), and contralateral deafness (one case).\n Eleven of these 12 patients were available for follow-up review.\n Tumor recurrence developed in two patients (18%) at 2 and 3 years postoperatively; there were no late recurrences.\n Four patients died of unrelated causes, 10 to 19 years after surgery.\n The remaining five patients have survived a mean of 12 years since surgery without recurrence (range 3 to 22 years).\n Facial function was preserved in nine patients (82%).\n The results suggest that radical intracapsular removal may be the procedure of choice under certain circumstances and may offer an alternative to focused high-energy radiation.",
