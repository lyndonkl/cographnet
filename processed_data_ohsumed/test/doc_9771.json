  "text": "Telephone use to elicit voice or speech in brain injured subjects.\n The initiation of speech is often delayed in the early stages of recovery from a serious brain injury.\n We have found a high percentage of patients with both speech and swallowing problems.\n This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study.\n The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury.\n This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to.\n Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room.\n The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences.\n Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without.\n This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety.\n It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma.",
