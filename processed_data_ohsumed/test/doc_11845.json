  "text": "Fatal reactions to intravenous nonionic contrast material.\n Three cases of fatality related to the use of low-osmolality contrast material (LOCM) are presented.\n LOCM definitely reduces unpleasant side effects and serious reactions, but data are currently insufficient to determine whether the death rate is any different from that associated with high-osmolality contrast agents.\n If the present trend toward universal conversion to LOCM continues, an enormous cost for little, if any, lifesaving benefit may be incurred.",
