  "text": "Meniere's disease: an immune complex-mediated illness?\n The cause of Meniere's disease is unknown.\n Recent clinical research suggests that one etiology is immune-mediated damage to the inner ear.\n The diagnosis of autoimmune Meniere's syndrome is largely based on history, response to steroids, or results of nonspecific laboratory tests such as serological studies.\n Polyethylene glycol (PEG) assay was used to determine levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in 30 patients with Meniere's disease and 20 control subjects.\n Patients with Meniere's disease had a statistically significant elevation of serum circulating immune complexes when compared to the control group.\n This suggests that CICs may be involved in the pathogenesis of Meniere's disease, either as a direct cause of damage, or as a by-product of an underlying autoimmune abnormality.\n Therapeutic implications include use of plasmapheresis to remove the complexes or CIC monitoring to serve as a marker for treatment efficacy.",
