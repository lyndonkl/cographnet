  "text": "Preliminary report: complement activation in wasp-sting anaphylaxis.\n The generation of the anaphylatoxin C3a was measured after a wasp-sting challenge in eight patients with previous anaphylactic reactions to wasp stings.\n Whereas there was no change in C3a in one patient who showed no reaction and only a slight rise in three patients with mild reactions, C3a rose substantially in the four patients with severe anaphylactic reactions.\n This complement activation is the first in-vitro variable which correlates with the severity of wasp-sting anaphylactic reactions.\n A role for complement activation in the pathophysiology of wasp-sting anaphylaxis is therefore suggested.",
