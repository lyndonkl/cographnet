  "text": "Oocyte and pre-embryo donation to women with ovarian failure: an extended clinical trial.\n The outcome of a series of pre-embryo transfers to 31 women with ovarian failure is described.\n Twenty six fertile women functioned as nonanonymous donors, providing oocytes for in vitro fertilization after undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and transvaginal ultrasound directed oocyte aspiration.\n Recipients, 24 to 44 years of age, received hormone replacement therapy before pre-embryo transfer (ET).\n A mean of 13.7 +/- 1.1 oocytes were obtained per aspiration resulting in the transfer of 4.5 +/- 0.2 pre-embryos to each recipient couple.\n Twenty-five of 47 ET resulted in pregnancy (53.2% per ET); 5 preclinical, and 20 clinical, of which 18 are ongoing or delivered.\n The overall implantation rate per individual transferred fresh pre-embryo was 21.1%.\n We conclude that oocyte donation is a safe and highly efficient means of achieving pregnancy for women with ovarian failure.",
