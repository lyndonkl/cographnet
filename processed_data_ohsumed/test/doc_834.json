  "text": "Conservation surgery for glomus jugulare tumors: the value of early diagnosis.\n The results of lateral cranial base surgery for glomus jugulare tumors are gratifying when normal anatomy and function can be preserved.\n The goal of conservation surgery is to preserve normal ear anatomy and cranial nerve function.\n In general, conservation surgery is tumor-size dependent.\n Thus, excellent states of functional recovery depend upon accurate early diagnosis.\n This paper reviews the technical aspects of transtemporal conservation skull base tumor surgery while also reviewing our experience with nearly 100 glomus jugulare patients.\n Adjuvants to early diagnosis will be highlighted from a review of presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and related diagnosis.\n Our objective is to provoke a high index of suspicion in physicians charged with the responsibility of diagnosing these tumors.\n Diagnostic guidelines are proposed.",
