  "text": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical surgery in locally advanced cervical cancer. Prognostic factors for response and survival.\n Between January 1986 and September 1988, 75 patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stages IB-III) received three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), including cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate (PBM).\n Fifteen percent of patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 68% a partial response (PR).\n Pretreatment characteristics were analyzed for response to NAC.\n Significantly lower response rates were found in patients with tumor size more than 5 cm in diameter and bilateral parametrial involvement to the pelvic side wall.\n None of the biological parameters studied was related to chemoresponsiveness.\n Patients achieving CR or PR had a significantly improved 3-year survival rate compared with those who did not respond.\n After NAC, radical surgery was possible in all responding patients.\n The median number of lymph nodes removed was 60.\n A lower than expected incidence of lymph node metastases was detected.\n None of the clinical and pathologic features considered was significantly correlated with the lymph node status.\n Twelve of the 62 operated patients had disease recurrence.\n Pathologic parametrial involvement and cervical infiltration equal to or deeper than 5 mm were found to be significant prognostic factors for recurrence.\n A 3-year, disease-free survival of 89%, 73%, and 43% for Stage IB-IIA, IIB, and III, respectively, was found.\n Among the operated patients these rates increased to 100%, 81%, and 66% for Stage IB-IIA, IIB, and III, respectively.\n A prospective randomized trial comparing NAC and surgery with radiotherapy alone is in progress.",
