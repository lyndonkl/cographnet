  "text": "The role of lasers in hemorrhoidectomy.\n Eighty-eight patients who received treatment for hemorrhoids were randomized into two groups.\n Group A received the Nd-YAG laser phototherapy for internal hemorrhoid combined with the CO2 laser for external hemorrhoid.\n Group B was treated with closed Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy.\n The need of narcotic injections for pain relief was 11 percent in group A vs.\n 56 percent in group B (P less than 0.001).\n The incidence of postoperative urinary retention was 7 percent in group A, vs.\n 39 percent in group B (P less than 0.05).\n No enema was required postoperatively in group A, vs.\n 9 percent in group B; 84 percent of the patients in group A were discharged on the second postoperative day, vs.\n 83 percent of the patients in group B discharged on the fifth postoperative day.\n The cost was 20 percent less in the former group.\n The overall complications in both groups were insignificant in difference, except prolonged wound healing in group A was noted.\n One year follow-up showed satisfactory results.\n Laser treatment is considered one of the alternatives to conventional treatment, but the surgeon needs to be aware of laser hazards.",
