  "text": "Monitoring of spinal cord stimulation evoked potentials during thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery.\n Repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm involves a significant risk of ischemic injury to the spinal cord.\n Standard monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, which relies upon peripheral nerve stimulation, becomes nonspecific and insensitive during this surgery when aortic cross-clamping produces lower extremity ischemia causing a peripheral conduction block.\n Techniques for the insertion of percutaneous epidural electrodes, developed originally for pain management, have been adapted to this setting to permit direct stimulation of the spinal cord for intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials.\n The clinical outcome in patients monitored by this technique has been consistent with evoked potential findings.",
