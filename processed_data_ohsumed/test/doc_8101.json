  "text": "Vascularized full-thickness parietal bone grafts in maxillofacial reconstruction: the role of the galea and superficial temporal vessels.\n Reconstruction of bony structures of the face is always a problem as big as the defect and the function that must be replaced.\n Everything from simple grafts to sophisticated distant bone flaps has been used.\n Based on the studies of Cutting et al., Psillakis et al., and Casanova et al., we have developed the full-thickness galeoparietal bone flap, initially for mandibular reconstruction, but of great use for all maxillofacial reconstructions.\n From July of 1987 to December of 1988, 14 patients have been operated on.\n The experience with this flap is shown in four patients as follows: primary reconstruction of a mandible as a result of ameloblastoma, secondary reconstruction of a mandible with associated old fractures and malalignment of segments, bilateral malar reconstruction in a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome, and severe sequelae of an already treated Romberg case.\n Small variations could be made to best accommodate the technique used to the defect we were treating.\n Some technical details, the experience, the results, and possible sequelae or complications are also discussed.",
