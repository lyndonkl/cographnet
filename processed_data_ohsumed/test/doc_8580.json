  "text": "Pleomorphic (anaplastic) neuroblastoma in nude mice.\n Two pleomorphic (anaplastic) neuroblastomas, from two children aged 1 and 6 years, were transplanted into nude mice.\n Two noteworthy observations were made.\n In one case, the transplanted tumor gave rise to a soft-tissue sarcoma.\n Moreover, in both cases hepatic metastases were associated with a striking modification of murine hepatocytes, resulting in hyperchromatic and dysplastic nuclei.\n The latter finding was particularly evident in the hepatic areas surrounding all metastases of pleomorphic (anaplastic) neuroblastoma cells.",
