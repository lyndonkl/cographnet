  "text": "Limitation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using iodized oil for small hepatocellular carcinoma. A study in resected cases.\n The radiologic and histologic findings are presented of the resection of 14 small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), less than 2 cm in maximum diameter, after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TCE) using iodized oil.\n The effect of TCE on small HCC depended on the morphologic type of the tumors.\n When no extracapsular invasion of tumor cells occurred, TCE was extremely effective against encapsulated tumors.\n However, in nine of the 14 resected specimens, viable tumor cells remained in or around the tumor.\n The authors suggest that small HCC are not always curable with TCE alone and that a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for patients with small HCC.",
