  "text": "A6--a new 45RO monoclonal antibody for immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissues.\n The authors report on the extensive characterization, on normal and pathologic tissues, of the T-cell-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) A6, which the authors previously found to identify a fixation- and paraffin-embedding-resistant epitope.\n A6 reacted with most T lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans' cells of normal tissues and with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (31 of 34), Ki-1+ lymphomas (12 of 18), and T-cell leukemias (1 of 5).\n All cases of X and non-X histiocytosis examined and monocytic leukemias with mature phenotype only were A6 positive.\n Three of 47 cases of B-cell lymphoma and leukemia were labeled.\n Hairy cell leukemias, multiple myelomas, and Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells were negative.\n The A6 reactivity was preserved with different fixatives (formalin, Bouin's fluid, Carnoy's fixative, and B5) and decalcification procedures and was slightly enhanced by trypsin digestion.\n The pattern of reactivity of A6 was similar to that obtained with MoAb UCHL-1, recognizing the CD45RO determinant of leukocyte common antigen; however, in pathologic tissues, A6 labeled a higher percentage of cells than UCHL-1.\n Cross-blocking and enzyme digestion studies (Pronase E [Sigma Chemical, St.\n Louis, MO] and neuraminidase [Sigma Chemical]) indicated that the two MoAbs may identify close epitopes on the same molecule.\n In conclusion, the authors' study indicates that A6 is an excellent reagent for detection of the CD45RO molecule on paraffin-embedded normal and pathologic tissues.",
