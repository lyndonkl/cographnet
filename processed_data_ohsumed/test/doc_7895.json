  "text": "Differentiation in embryonal neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system.\n Ninety-six embryonal neuroectodermal tumors were studied histologically and immunohistologically with a panel of antibodies including glial, neuronal, epithelial, mesodermal, and myelin markers.\n In 71 tumors there was glial and neuronal differentiation and expression both of an S (photoreceptor) antigen and vimentin.\n In five tumors there was only glial differentiation and in 20 tumors only neuronal differentiation.\n No reactivity for myelin and epithelial markers was found.\n Histologic and immunohistologic findings identified various degrees of differentiation in different tumors, which was bipolar (glial and neuronal) in most tumors and unipolar in the remainder.\n The authors suggest that their findings may be the result of normal or aberrant oncogenic differentiation, agreeing with the nomenclature of the World Health Organization classification for these tumors with and the inclusion of a category for ependymoblastoma.",
