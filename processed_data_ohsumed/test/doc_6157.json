  "text": "Radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radioactive gold seed placement: results of treatment at 5 and 10 years for clinical stages A2, B1 and B2 cancer of the prostate.\n Between 1977 and 1988, 131 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent combined radical prostatectomy and intraoperative radioactive gold seed placement.\n Of these 131 patients 80 were clinically assessed as having stage A2 (12), B1 (43) or B2 (25) cancer and they are the subject of this review.\n The average dose of radioactivity administered to each patient was 96.6 mCi, and mean followup was 65 months (median 64 months).\n No patient in this series received any other form of adjuvant therapy until disease recurrence was demonstrated.\n Local recurrences were observed in 2 patients (2.5%) in this series while distant recurrences were observed in 10 (12.5%).\n Cancer specific survival free of disease at 5 years was 100% for clinical stage A2, 91% for B1 and 75% for B2 cancers.\n The 10-year survival free of disease was 100% for clinical stage A2, 82% for B1 and 68% for B2 cancers.\n Covariants of clinical stage and seminal vesicle involvement influenced survival free of disease in a statistically significant manner (p less than 0.05) while pathological stage and degree of tumor differentiation did not.\n Mild to severe complications were observed in 12 patients (15%).\n Intraoperative placement of radioactive gold seeds into unresected pelvic tissues surrounding the site of prostatectomy offers a theoretical advantage in treatment by delivering tumoricidal levels of irradiation to residual foci of cancer not appreciated at the time of surgery.\n Our results suggest that increases in cancer specific survival free of disease over that previously reported for prostatectomy alone may be achieved through this combined treatment regimen.\n Furthermore, it is our opinion that therapeutic gains can be achieved without the attendant increases in morbidity and treatment delay often associated with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy.",
