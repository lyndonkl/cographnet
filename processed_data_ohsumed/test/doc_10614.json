  "text": "Three-dimensional computerized tomography in the evaluation of laryngeal injury.\n A comparison of diagnostic information obtained from the physical examination, conventional two-dimensional axial computerized tomography scanning (2-D CT), and three-dimensional display computerized tomography (3-D CT) was performed in five patients sustaining laryngeal trauma.\n Four patients had laryngeal fractures and one patient had an incompletely ossified thyroid cartilage (normal variant) simulating a fracture by 2-D CT.\n Three-dimensional display computerized tomography was found superior to conventional 2-D CT in assessing the presence and nature of the laryngeal injuries while correctly identifying the anatomic variant.",
