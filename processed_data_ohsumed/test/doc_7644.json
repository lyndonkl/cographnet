  "text": "Scintigraphic evaluation of aggressive fibromatosis.\n Despite its benign microscopic appearance, aggressive fibromatosis has potential to recur and infiltrate neighboring tissues.\n Therefore, it is necessary to determine the exact extent before therapy.\n In the present study, 11 cases of aggressive fibromatosis were examined scintigraphically using [99mTc(V)]dimercaptosuccinic acid (11 cases) and 67Ga-citrate (7 cases).\n Technetium-99m-(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid demonstrated all lesions, while 67Ga-citrate detected 57% of the cases.",
