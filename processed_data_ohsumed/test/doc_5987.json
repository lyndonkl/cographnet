  "text": "Kinetic modeling of intracellular pH and comparison with 31P NMR experimental values in dialysed uremic patients.\n Changes in intra-erythrocytic pH values over time, during and after bicarbonate hemodialysis, were studied with 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.\n Simultaneously, pH values of whole blood were obtained by a gazometric method.\n A two-compartment model appeared to be the simplest kinetic model to explain the shifts in proton concentrations in extra- and intra-cellular media.\n Non-linear regression was used to determine exchange constant values.\n There was a very good correlation between the experimental and calculated proton concentrations.\n This model can describe all patients but individual experimental constants must be determined.\n Under these conditions a single blood pH determination before dialysis will permit determination of the initial intra-erythrocytic pH and monitoring of intra-erythrocytic pH during hemodialysis.",
