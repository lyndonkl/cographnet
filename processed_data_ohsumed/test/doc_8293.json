  "text": "Multimodality therapy for advanced and recurrent vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. A pilot project.\n From 1985 to 1989 eight women with advanced or recurrent vulvar carcinoma were treated at the Women's Cancer Center of the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic.\n Each received a combination of 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C and cisplatin during radiotherapy.\n Five of the eight women who underwent posttreatment radical vulvectomy had acceptable operative morbidity.\n Six patients experienced a complete clinical response.\n Of them, one had microscopic residual disease in the surgical specimen.\n One patient with recurrent vulvar carcinoma experienced progression of disease on therapy.\n One death was attributable to chemotherapy toxicity, and two patients died of intercurrent disease.\n The overall survival rate at 27 months was 33%.\n This multimodality approach to the treatment of advanced vulvar carcinoma should be considered when designing a therapeutic approach to treating extensive or resistant vulvar carcinoma.",
