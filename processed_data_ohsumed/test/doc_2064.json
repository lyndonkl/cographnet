  "text": "Predictors of cardiac survival after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.\n To assess the outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and to determine the predictors of mortality, 73 patients with LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% who underwent initial PTCA were analyzed.\n The majority of patients had prior (greater than 1 week) myocardial infarction (62 patients, 85%).\n Congestive heart failure and unstable angina were present in 24 (45%) and 49 (67%) patients, respectively.\n Multivessel coronary artery disease was present in 60 (83%).\n The LV ejection fraction ranged from 14 to 40% (mean 34%).\n Intraaortic balloon pump (15%) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support (4%) was used infrequently.\n Angiographic success was obtained in 109 of 128 lesions (85%) attempted.\n Complete revascularization was obtained in 16 of 60 patients with clinical success.\n Procedure-related mortality was 5% (4 patients).\n All patients were followed from greater than or equal to 6 to less than or equal to 71 months (average 26).\n The estimated survival was 79 +/- 5%, 74 +/- 6%, 66 +/- 7% and 57 +/- 8% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively.\n A Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of congestive heart failure, a lower LV ejection fraction and a higher myocardial jeopardy score for contractile myocardium were independent predictors of survival after PTCA in patients with LV dysfunction.\n In conclusion, a high-risk subset can be identified among patients with severe LV dysfunction who undergo PTCA.",
