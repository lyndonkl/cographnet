Choosing and timing treatment.\n Patients with gallstone pancreatitis are often seen initially by primary care physicians.\n Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality.\n Initial management should include supportive medical care and surgical consultation.\n The timing of surgery is then dictated by serum enzyme levels and liver function test results as well as by the patient's condition.\n The role of endoscopic intervention is currently evolving.\n Whether surgery or endoscopic sphincterotomy is preferable as primary therapy for gallstone pancreatitis remains unresolved.\n However, sphincterotomy with stone extraction is a viable option in selected cases, especially in patients who have severe gallstone pancreatitis.",
