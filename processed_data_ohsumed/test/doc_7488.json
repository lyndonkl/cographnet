Report of a case and review of the literature.\n Gastrointestinal hemorrhage from left-sided portal hypertension and gastric varices is an unusual presentation for islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas.\n Islet cell tumors of the pancreas themselves are rare.\n They present in a variety of ways.\n Those that elaborate functional hormones cause specific neuroendocrine syndromes.\n Nonfunctional tumors characteristically present later with symptoms of metastatic disease or as a result of local enlargement.\n We present a case of islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices and review the literature for this rare presentation.\n We emphasize the importance of a careful initial diagnostic work-up that may enable curative surgery.",
