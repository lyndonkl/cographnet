  "text": "Cognitive function and time-of-day variation in serum carbamazepine concentration in epileptic patients treated with monotherapy.\n Different parameters of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment have been shown to affect cognitive function.\n The drug, dose, and duration of treatment have been studied.\n The present study assessed cognitive function in relation to time-of-day variation in serum carbamazepine (CBZ) concentration in epileptic patients treated with monotherapy.\n We studied 10 males and 12 females with a mean age of 36 years and a mean duration of CBZ-therapy of 4.4 years.\n Patients had been seizure-free for at least 1 month and took two daily CBZ doses.\n The test battery included tests of motor speed, reaction time, attention, and memory.\n In the experimental design, the subjects were tested twice at times close to expected daily maximum and minimum serum CBZ concentration.\n They were studied in two balanced blocks (block 1 tested at 8 a.m.\n and noon, block 2 tested at noon and 8 p.m.).\n Blood samples were collected every 2 hr from 8 a.m.\n to 8 p.m.\n The subjects showed significant differences in serum CBZ concentration between testing times, with suggested maximum concentration between 10 a.m.\n and noon.\n The test battery showed no consistent differences between performance at times of high versus low serum concentration.\n A supplementary analysis of correlations between mean performance level on cognitive tests and variables related to CBZ treatment did not show consistent trends.",
