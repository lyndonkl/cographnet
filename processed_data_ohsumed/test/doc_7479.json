  "text": "Total sacrectomy and reconstruction for huge sacral tumors.\n The authors carried out successful total sacrectomy in three cases, two with giant cell tumors and one with a chordoma.\n The anterior and posterior approach is feasible for resecting huge sacral tumors en bloc, but it is important to reconstruct the continuity between the pelvic ring and spinal column using spinal instrumentation and sacral rods or AO plates.\n As total sacrectomy is a large-scale, time-consuming, and collaborative operation, two or three teams should be used in relays.\n Both pelvic and spinal surgical techniques are required.\n Post-operatively the patient can stand within 3 to 6 months and well-planned rehabilitation allows ambulation.\n In spite of the serious structural and neurologic damage caused, total sacrectomy can be rewarding procedure in terms of improved morbidity and mortality.",
