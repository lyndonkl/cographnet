  "text": "Haemospermia: a prospective study.\n A prospective study of 74 men with haemospermia is presented.\n Most (76%) had experienced 1 or 2 episodes only and 9 (12%) were over 40 years old.\n Simple investigations led to a diagnosis in all 9 of these men and of those under 40, no pathology could be detected in 48%.\n A diagnosis was made in 32 of the remaining 34 men by simple investigations.\n In patients over 40 years of age with haemospermia, a potentially treatable cause will normally be found by routine investigation which should include cystoscopy.\n In younger men, non-invasive investigation alone should identify any pathology.\n Invasive investigations should be reserved for those patients in whom the problem is prolonged, excessive or in association with other symptoms.",
