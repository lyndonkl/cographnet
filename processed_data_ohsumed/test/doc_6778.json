  "text": "Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.\n Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a rare condition and is poorly recognized in the otolaryngological literature.\n The condition is characterized by the appearance of cutaneous nodules within the head and neck region especially around the external ear.\n Variable lymphadenopathy and peripheral eosinophilia can occur and the condition can mimic neoplasia.\n It is important to be aware of this disease entity in order to avoid overtreatment.\n Surgical removal is the treatment of choice; however, this often multilobulated and poorly delineated lesion often precludes initial wide excision and local recurrence is common.\n We present three cases of this unusual condition and a brief resume of the literature.",
