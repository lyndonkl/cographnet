  "text": "The reliability of palpation in the assessment of tumours.\n There is now a joint UICC-AJC classification for cervical lymph nodes based mainly on the size of the nodes.\n There is a recognized error in palpation, not only for detecting the presence of tumour but also its size.\n This study used an animal tumour model system to compare the ability of 6 independent observers of varying experience to detect and stage superficially transplanted growths.\n A preclinical medical student was as good as a Consultant ENT Surgeon in predicting the presence of tumour but the ability to stage tumours accurately was related to experience.\n Whilst the most experienced observers accurately estimated the size of tumours less than 2 cm, they were less accurate for larger (greater than 2 cm) tumours which were constantly understaged.\n This phenomenon may have important clinical implications particularly related to current nodal staging criteria.",
