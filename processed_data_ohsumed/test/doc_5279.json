  "text": "Comparison of a 3- and 6-mm incision in combined phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy.\n We studied 216 eyes of 160 patients who underwent combined phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation with trabeculectomy.\n The mean follow-up was 18.7 months, with a minimum follow-up of six months.\n To assess the safety and efficacy of a recently developed 3-mm incision procedure with foldable intraocular lens implantation (phacotrabeculectomy), we compared 104 eyes subjected to this procedure with 112 eyes subjected to a 6-mm procedure at different follow-up periods.\n Intraocular pressure control (less than 21 mm Hg) was attained in 44 of 46 eyes (96%) in the 3-mm group and 71 of 76 eyes (93%) in the 6-mm group at one year postoperatively.\n Visual acuity of 20/40 or better was attained in 40 of 46 eyes (87%) in the 3-mm group and 66 of 76 eyes (87%) in the 6-mm group.\n The incidence of postoperative complication was significantly lower (P less than .001) and visual acuity in the early postoperative period was significantly better (P less than .01) in the 3-mm incision group than in the comparison group.",
