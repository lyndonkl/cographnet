  "text": "Glomus tumor of the coccyx. A curable cause of coccygodynia.\n A 30-year-old woman presented with recurrent severe coccygodynia.\n She underwent exploration for a possible pilonidal sinus and was found to have a precoccygeal glomus tumor that also involved bony trabeculae of the coccyx.\n To our knowledge, a glomus tumor involving the coccygeal bone has not been previously documented.\n In view of the relief of this patient's pain following the surgical excision of coccyx and tumor, a causal role is suggested.",
