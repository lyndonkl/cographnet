  "text": "The Caspar microsurgical discectomy and comparison with a conventional standard lumbar disc procedure.\n The outcome in 119 patients who were operated on with a conventional standard lumbar discectomy procedure was retrospectively compared with that in 299 patients who were operated on with a microsurgical discectomy technique developed in Homburg/Saar, Federal Republic of Germany by the senior author (W.C.).\n All patients in this consecutive series had \"virgin\" lumbar radiculopathy evaluated and operated upon by two experienced surgeons at one institution.\n Determination of the final outcome was made objectively by an impartial third party using identical criteria for both groups, and with a patient self-evaluation form.\n The study looked at various pertinent aspects of the treatment course and at final outcome.\n The results in the microsurgical group were significantly favorable: fewer levels were explored: there was less operative blood loss and a decreased incidence of deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infections, pulmonary emboli, and bladder catheterization; the time to full ambulation, discharge, and return to work was faster: and there was a decrease in change of occupation and a greater percentage of satisfactory final outcomes, as measured both objectively and subjectively.\n A description of the microsurgical technique used in this study, which differs significantly from existing microdisectomy techniques, is presented.\n The authors conclude that the microsurgical disectomy technique presented in this study is a safe and effective approach to the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy.",
