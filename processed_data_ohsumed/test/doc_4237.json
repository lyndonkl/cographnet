  "text": "Spinal anaesthesia in day-care surgery with a 26-gauge needle.\n We studied 106 day-care surgical patients (52 male) aged 18-70 yr (mean 49.6 yr) who received spinal anaesthesia with a 26-gauge spinal needle.\n The incidence of headache, back pain and patient acceptability were investigated after operation using a questionnaire.\n The incidence of postspinal headache was 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients developed back pain.\n One patient remained in hospital because of hypotension and dizziness.\n There were no major complications and patient acceptability was almost 100%.\n We conclude that spinal anaesthesia for day-care surgery is easy to perform and cost effective.",
