  "text": "Neurinoma in the cavernous sinus: report of two cases.\n Two cases of trigeminal neurinoma located solely in the cavernous sinus are reported.\n Preoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging provided the accurate localization of the lesions, allowing precise planning of the surgical approach, that is, a subtemporal lateral approach and a pterional superior approach, respectively.\n The neurinomas inside the cavernous sinus were removed successfully, and the patients developed no new neurological deficits except for anesthesia in the 1st division of the trigeminal nerve.\n The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed.",
