  "text": "Levamisole and 5-fluorouracil therapy for resected colon cancer: a new indication.\n OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of postoperative treatment with levamisole plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colon cancer.\n DESIGN: Computerized searches of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT were performed, and the reference list of each retrieved article was checked.\n Only randomized trials of therapy with levamisole alone or combined with 5-FU for colon cancer without distant metastases were included.\n The studies were then evaluated with the use of four criteria.\n RESULTS: We reviewed six randomized trials, of which three satisfied our criteria.\n Two studies demonstrated a significant improvement in the survival rate with levamisole plus 5-FU among patients with colon cancer and pathologically confirmed metastases to adjacent lymph nodes (Dukes' stage C).\n A subgroup analysis in another study demonstrated a similar benefit.\n The toxic effects of the drugs were generally mild.\n The three other studies showed no difference in survival rates between the treatment groups; however, the samples were too small to detect a clinically or statistically important difference.\n CONCLUSIONS: Because many patients with colon cancer will suffer a relapse we recommend that they be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy.\n For those with stage C disease not entering a clinical trial levamisole plus 5-FU is appropriate adjuvant therapy.",
