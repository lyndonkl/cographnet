  "text": "Interferons and collagen production.\n The immunoregulatory, antiviral, and antiproliferative agents known as the interferons have profound effects on collagen synthesis.\n Interferons alpha, beta, and gamma suppress collagen synthesis by dermal fibroblasts.\n In addition, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits the constitutively increased collagen synthesis characteristic of fibroblasts derived from lesions of patients with scleroderma.\n IFN-gamma also inhibits collagen synthesis by myofibroblasts and synovial fibroblast-like cells.\n Inhibition of collagen synthesis by IFN-gamma is associated with a coordinate inhibition of transcription for types I and III collagen.\n In addition, IFN-gamma suppresses levels of procollagen mRNA and type II collagen synthesis in human articular chondrocytes.\n In vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that IFN-gamma inhibits the collagen synthesis associated with the fibrotic response to an implanted foreign body, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and the healing response to cutaneous thermal burns.\n In the latter case, while collagen content of the wound scar was decreased, hyaluronic acid was increased in mice receiving IFN-gamma compared to controls.\n This is in accord with in vitro studies showing that, while interferons alpha and beta decrease production of glycosaminoglycans, IFN-gamma increases production of glycosaminoglycans.\n Of interest, acute inflammation at sites of thermal injury, or when elicited by proinflammatory agents in separate experiments, also was suppressed in mice treated with IFN-gamma.\n The means by which IFN-gamma inhibits collagen synthesis involves transcriptional regulation.\n There is a single report that interferon alpha can decrease the size of a keloid of recent onset in a human patient.\n Because the interferons can inhibit collagen synthesis in vivo, further studies may be warranted to evaluate the usefulness of these agents in the treatment of disease states characterized by abnormal fibrotic responses as well as their potential for altering the healing response associated with particular therapeutic interventions.",
