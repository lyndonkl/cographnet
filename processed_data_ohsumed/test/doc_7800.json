  "text": "Imaging modalities in recurrent head and neck tumors.\n Patients with recurrent neoplasms of the head and neck present perplexing management problems, and accurate preoperative assessment of their disease is crucial.\n Thirty-eight patients with suspected recurrent neoplasms comprise this study: 30 had computed tomography scans, 4 had magnetic resonance images, and 4 patients underwent both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to assess the anatomical extent of pathology in 34 malignant and 4 benign tumors.\n Contrast enhancement was essential for detecting disease on computed tomography scan.\n Differentiation of recurrent tumor was more difficult when the patient had undergone radiation.\n Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated superior visibility in recurrent parotid and paranasal sinus neoplasm, but was less helpful in laryngeal and pharyngeal recurrences.\n Computed tomography demonstration of a mass with infiltration of normal fat or tissue planes or lymphadenopathy correlated highly with recurrent disease.\n Imaging techniques and fine points for determining recurrent neoplasms are presented.",
