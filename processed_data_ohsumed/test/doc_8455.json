  "text": "Treatment of anovulation due to polycystic ovarian syndrome by laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery.\n Our experience of ovarian electrocautery for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in ten women is described.\n We found that nine responded favourably, either ovulating spontaneously or becoming more responsive to ovulation induction.\n There was a significant and persistent fall in serum testosterone levels, and a transient fall with subsequent rise in inhibin.\n We recommend that laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery is considered as an alternative to ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, in women with PCOS who fail to respond to clomiphene citrate.",
