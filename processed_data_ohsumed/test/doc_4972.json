  "text": "Inflammatory response in retrieved noncemented porous-coated implants.\n One hundred forty-six noncemented porous-coated hip and knee implants retrieved from 97 patients were evaluated histologically for the type, amount, and anatomic distribution of tissue ingrowth.\n The degree of inflammatory cell infiltrate present was also evaluated and the predominant cell type was identified.\n An inflammatory infiltrate was present in the components of 21 of 97 patients (22%).\n In 16 of the 21 cases the infiltrate was lymphocytes and histiocytes with a minor population of plasma cells.\n One of the remaining five cases had a predominately plasma cell reaction, and the other four had significant populations of plasma cells.\n Vascular proliferation was observed in nine of the 21 cases.\n Bone ingrowth was present in ten of the 21 cases.\n A 38% incidence of removal for persistent pain was present in cases with an inflammatory infiltrate.\n Seventeen of 87 patients (20%) with cobalt-chromium devices and four of ten patients (40%) with titanium devices were identified as having an inflammatory infiltrate.\n The origin of the inflammatory infiltrate is unclear.\n All patients with inflammatory infiltrates had noninfected implants, which were not loose roentgenographically or clinically at the time of removal.\n Hypersensitivity and allergic responses to metal ions may produce such infiltrates.\n It is impossible, however, in the present study to definitively determine the etiology of the infiltrates.",
