  "text": "Association of self-reported injury and alcohol consumption in medical outpatients.\n OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the association between minor injury and level of alcohol consumption among adult outpatients.\n DESIGN: Self-administered survey of alcohol use and level of injury in prior month.\n SETTING: Adult outpatients attending a university-based general internal medicine private practice.\n PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: During a four-month period, 1,011 patients aged 18-65 years were asked to complete questionnaires while waiting to see a physician.\n The 791 who completed all forms appropriately are included in this study.\n INTERVENTION: None.\n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The total number of drinks and the total number of injuries reported during the preceding month were calculated.\n Nondrinkers reported an average of 0.51 (SD = 1.18) injuries in the prior month; and drinkers, 0.92 (SD = 1.70) injuries.\n Minor injuries were reported more frequently by heavier alcohol consumers only among younger patients (RR = 1.88).\n There was no association between reported injury and alcohol consumption among patients over 50 years of age (RR = 0.90).\n CONCLUSIONS: Minor injury is associated with heavier alcohol consumption in younger patients attending a general medical practice, but not among older patients.\n Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship between alcohol drinking and minor injury.",
