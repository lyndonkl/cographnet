  "text": "Ectopic thyroid tissue in the submandibular region.\n This report describes an unusual location of ectopic thyroid gland tissue.\n A growth in the left submandibular area was surgically excised, and the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed thyroid tissue with colloid goiter.\n Because this entity cannot be clinically distinguished from a salivary gland tumor, ectopic thyroid tissue should be considered in the differential diagnosis of swellings involving the submandibular area.",
