  "text": "Kupffer cell activation and endothelial cell damage after storage of rat livers: effects of reperfusion.\n Reperfusion injury characterized by loss of endothelial cell viability occurs after cold ischemic storage of livers for transplantation surgery.\n Here, ultrastructural changes in stored rat livers were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.\n With increasing times of storage in Euro-Collins solution (4 to 24 hr) followed by 15 min of reperfusion at 37 degrees C, a sequence of structural alterations was observed involving endothelial and Kupffer cells.\n Widening of endothelial fenestrations occurred after 4 hr and progressed over 8 to 24 hr to retraction of cellular processes, ball-like rounding, sinusoidal denudation and ultrastructural derangements consistent with loss of cell viability.\n Kupffer cells exhibited progressive rounding, ruffling of the cell surface, polarization, appearance of wormlike densities, vacuolization and degranulation over a similar time course.\n By contrast, the structures of parenchymal and fat-storing cells were relatively undisturbed by cold storage and reperfusion.\n Alterations to endothelial and Kupffer cells were also studied as a function of time of reperfusion.\n After 24 hr of storage, endothelial cells showed retraction of cytoplasm before reperfusion that progressed quickly to loss of viability and denudation during reperfusion.\n Kupffer cell activation (ruffling, degranulation) during reperfusion was slower and occurred after deterioration of endothelial cells.\n Livers stored in Euro-Collins solution were also compared with livers stored in University of Wisconsin cold storage solution, an improved preservation medium for transplantation.\n University of Wisconsin solution provided better preservation of endothelial structure and markedly reduced parenchymal cell blebbing and swelling before reperfusion.\n University of Wisconsin solution also reduced Kupffer cell activation and release of lysosomal enzymes.\n In conclusion, endothelial cell deterioration followed by Kupffer cell activation occurred after increasing times of cold ischemic storage and reperfusion of rat livers.\n Both changes may contribute to the pathophysiology of graft failure caused by reperfusion-mediated storage injury.",
