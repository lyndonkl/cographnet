  "text": "Solitary, isolated metastasis from Ewing's sarcoma to the brain: case report.\n We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed an intraparenchymal cerebral metastasis from a Ewing's sarcoma of the chest wall diagnosed and treated 3 years earlier and in apparent remission at the time of the neurological presentation (seizures).\n The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis.\n The tumor and the hematoma were removed.\n The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given.\n Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint.",
