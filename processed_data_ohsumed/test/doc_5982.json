  "text": "Bacteremia due to Escherichia coli: a study of 861 episodes.\n Escherichia coli accounted for 861 (23.9%) of 3,605 episodes of bacteremia in an 18-year prospective survey at St.\n Thomas' Hospital, a proportion that changed little during the survey.\n The most common focus of infection leading to nosocomial and community-acquired bacteremia due to E.\n coli was the urinary tract.\n Twenty-six percent of adult female patients with E.\n coli bacteremia resulting from a urinary tract infection were diabetic.\n The O antigen serotypes identified most often were O6, O2, O1, O4, O15, and O75; the multiply resistant O15 serotype of E.\n coli was implicated in a community outbreak of urinary tract infection.\n Ampicillin resistance in strains causing community-acquired infection increased to the same level as that of strains causing nosocomial infection (almost 50%).\n The overall mortality was 20.7% and was greater in the presence of shock (52.4% vs.\n 15.3%).\n Death due to infection occurred in 2.6% and 10.3%, respectively, of cases with urinary tract and non-urinary tract foci.\n The adverse influence of inappropriate initial therapy on outcome was more marked in the latter half of the study.",
