  "text": "Reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release after rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n Serial blood samples were obtained from 80 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to study adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane B2 release.\n The goal of the investigation was to detect whether reduced platelet function is involved in rebleeds.\n Seventeen patients (21%) suffered a rebleed, six of those experiencing their first rebleed within 24 hours after SAH.\n Therefore, most platelet function studies were performed after rebleeds.\n Thromboxane release was lower in patients with rebleeds than in the others, both before and after rebleeding, although statistical significance was reached only in samples collected after rebleeds.\n Patients rebleeding within 24 hours after SAH had lower platelet aggregability (p = 0.037) than patients without a rebleed in the samples taken within 3 days after SAH.\n The results suggest that reduced platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are involved in rebleeds following primary SAH.",
