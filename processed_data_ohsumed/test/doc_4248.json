  "text": "Pharyngeal volume in asymptomatic snorers compared with nonsnoring volunteers.\n STUDY OBJECTIVE: to determine if asymptomatic snorers have smaller pharyngeal volumes than age- and height-matched nonsnorers.\n DESIGN: we recruited asymptomatic heavy snorers and nonsnorers for a study.\n Each snorer was matched by age (+/- 3 years) and height (+/- 2 inches) with a nonsnorer.\n The nonsnorers were required to be near ideal body weight.\n All volunteers underwent overnight polysomnography, pulmonary function testing, and magnetic resonance imaging of the pharynx while awake.\n The volume of the pharynx was determined by a computer with data input from a digitizing instrument.\n SETTING: Veterans Administration Hospital and University of Florida Teaching Hospital PARTICIPANTS: Nine volunteers were recruited for both the snorer and nonsnorer groups.\n Each participant was paid $50.\n There were no interventions.\n MEASUREMENTS and RESULTS: There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups.\n There was also no significant difference between pharyngeal volumes for the two groups.\n CONCLUSIONS: The volume of the pharynx in asymptomatic snorers is similar to the volume in age- and height-matched nonsnorers.",
