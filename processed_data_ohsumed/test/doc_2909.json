  "text": "Chronic therapy for congestive heart failure with benazepril HCl, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.\n Benazepril HCl is an orally effective angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor previously shown to have significant acute hemodynamic benefits in patients with congestive heart failure.\n In this study, 21 patients with New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure were treated with 2 to 15 mg of benazepril HCl as a single daily oral dose for 28 days to determine the clinical and hemodynamic value of chronic therapy.\n Each patient underwent clinical evaluation during the 28-day period, as well as invasive hemodynamic studies on the first two and last two days of the trial.\n Plasma ACE activity and aldosterone levels fell significantly and renin levels rose after therapy.\n Benazepril HCl produced significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, with corresponding increases in cardiac output and decreases in pulmonary artery wedge pressure.\n Responses after 28 days of therapy were equivalent to those after the initial doses.\n Clinical effects included reduced rest, exertional and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, as well as reduced peripheral edema.\n Only one patient developed symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.\n Thus, benazepril HCl, given once daily, is an effective and well tolerated oral agent for the chronic treatment of advanced congestive heart failure.",
