  "text": "Status epilepticus in infancy and childhood.\n Status epilepticus implies a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures with persistent decreased consciousness, lasting at least 30 minutes.\n Both convulsive and nonconvulsive forms exist, either of which may lead to death or additional neurologic deficit.\n Therapy involves careful supportive care plus some combination of benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital.\n The outcome depends first on the etiology and second on the rapidity with which seizures are controlled.",
