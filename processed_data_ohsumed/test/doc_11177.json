  "text": "Parathyroidectomy in chronic renal failure: indications, surgical approach and the use of calcitriol.\n The appropriate use of phosphate binders, calcium supplements and especially calcitriol therapy has significantly decreased the incidence of overt secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients.\n Nevertheless some patients may still need parathyroidectomy, especially in the event of severe clinical signs and symptoms such as persistent hypercalcemia, pruritus, calcifilaxis, or extensive extra-skeletal calcification.\n Since aluminum-induced bone disease may resemble hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients, whenever parathyroidectomy is contemplated the diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism must be firmly established.\n Thus, a bone biopsy is mandatory prior to parathyroidectomy.\n It is our experience that once the patient goes to surgery the most important factor in the surgical approach is the presence of a skilled surgeon who has extensive experience in parathyroid gland surgery.\n The data comparing subtotal parathyroidectomy with total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation are similar.\n The most important shortcoming is the lack of long-term follow-up.\n Recently, new data by several investigators has been advanced reintroducing total parathyroidectomy.\n Long-term observations in patients who despite total parathyroidectomy still have normal PTH levels are of special interest.\n In addition, long-term follow-up of these patients has shown that normal plasma calcium and phosphorus levels may be maintained without the use of Vitamin D; this occurred in the presence of active mineralization.\n However, our major objection to this procedure is the risk of aluminum-induced bone disease.\n At the present time we feel that the relative high incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism following subtotal parathyroidectomy is a reasonable trade off for the risk of aluminum bone disease which may develop in absence of PTH.",
