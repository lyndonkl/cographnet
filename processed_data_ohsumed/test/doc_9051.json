  "text": "Cognitive strategies during coincident timing tasks.\n Research findings suggest that experience and cognitive strategies contribute to successful performance during perceptual-motor tasks.\n This article critically reviews selected literature on the effects of information-processing skills, preferred movement time, experience, and task difficulty on performance during coincident timing tasks.\n Theoretical information and research findings are discussed, and their applications to clinical practice are considered.\n Clinical recommendations include assessment of coincident timing skills and use of functional activities that provide opportunities to explore and dynamically interact with the environment.",
