  "text": "Suppression of type II collagen-induced arthritis by monoclonal antibodies.\n Some mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against chicken type II collagen suppressed or delayed the onset of chicken type II collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice.\n This was correlated with the suppression of anti-mouse type II collagen antibody responses following immunization with chicken type II collagen.\n The epitopes recognized by the suppressive antibodies were found to be present on cyanogen bromide (CB)-digested collagen peptides CB-11 and CB-12.\n This was also confirmed by the finding that administration of the CB-11 or CB-12 peptide suppressed the induction of arthritis.",
