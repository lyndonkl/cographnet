  "text": "Cefmetazole and cefonicid. Comparative efficacy and safety in preventing postoperative infections after vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy.\n A single 1-g dose of cefmetazole was compared with a single 1-g dose of cefonicid for prophylaxis in vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy to determine their efficacy and safety.\n The antibiotics were administered intramuscularly 15-90 minutes before the incision was made.\n Cefmetazole and cefonicid had similar activity against most of the aerobic organisms recovered, but cefmetazole was significantly more active against anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms.\n The patterns of regrowth of vaginal flora were similar in the two treatment groups.\n Patient demographic characteristics and surgical procedures were similar in both groups.\n The difference in primary prophylactic failure (e.g., cuff cellulitis) with the two study drugs (1 of 53 [1.9%] with cefmetazole and 2 of 28 [7.1%] with cefonicid) did not reach statistical significance, and the results were similar for the two routes of hysterectomy.\n Cefmetazole, at a dose of 1 g intramuscularly preoperatively, is a safe and effective agent for prophylaxis during hysterectomy.",
