  "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium: report of a successful resection with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.\n Hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has been considered beyond the reach of resection.\n These patients usually die within a short period because of pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cancer progression.\n The only treatment is hepatic resection with removal of the tumor thrombus.\n A 38-year-old woman underwent left lobectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.\n The patient had an uneventful course and is doing well 15 months after surgery, without signs of recurrence.\n We have proved that hepatic resection with removal of a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium can be carried out successfully.\n The next problem is whether the lives of these patients can be prolonged by this operation.",
