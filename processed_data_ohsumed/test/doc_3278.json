  "text": "Endocarditis in the 80s in a general hospital in Auckland, New Zealand.\n The clinical and investigative features of 102 episodes of infective endocarditis were analysed retrospectively.\n The most frequent presenting symptoms (malaise, fever, sweats, myalgia, weight loss) were non-specific.\n Fever, cardiac murmur, tachycardia, vascular phenomena and a change in mental state were the most common physical signs at admission.\n Anaemia was present in half the episodes and renal and liver dysfunction in about one-third.\n Streptococci (61) and staphylococci (31) were the causative organisms in all but 10 episodes.\n The commonest predisposing factors were underlying cardiac disease (52 per cent) and a preceding focus of infection (14.6 per cent).\n Left ventricular failure (33 per cent) and focal neurological disease (29 per cent) occurred frequently.\n Valvular surgery was performed in 20 episodes, with two in-hospital deaths.\n Overall hospital mortality was 27.5 per cent and death was most commonly neurological (11/28).\n A higher mortality was associated with elevated total white blood count, microscopic haematuria, renal or liver dysfunction at admission, S.\n aureus endocarditis, the development of left ventricular failure or focal neurological disease, age greater than or equal to 60 years and persistence of fever after one week of antibiotic therapy.\n The absence of both renal dysfunction at admission and subsequent microscopic haematuria identified a group with a very low hospital mortality (4.7 per cent).\n The three-year mortality of the entire group was 43.5 per cent.",
