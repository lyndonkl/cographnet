  "text": "Tumoral thrombosis of cerebral venous sinuses: preoperative diagnosis using magnetic resonance phase imaging.\n Intracranial, dural-based neoplasms will not infrequently invade adjacent venous sinuses.\n Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis of venous invasion is important, as it will alter the surgical approach to the lesion.\n Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive means of visualizing the cerebral venous sinuses.\n The preoperative diagnosis of venous thrombosis can, however, be difficult and confusing with conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging because of variable appearances produced by blood clot degradation products as well as flowing blood.\n Phase magnetic resonance imaging is a simple method that can be acquired simultaneously with conventional spin-echo sequences, and is based primarily on whether protons are stationary or moving.\n In the context of venous sinus occlusion, phase imaging can demonstrate the presence or absence of blood flow more easily than spin-echo imaging.\n Three cases of dural-based neoplasms are presented that demonstrate the utility of phase imaging in diagnosing tumoral occlusion of the venous sinuses.",
