  "text": "Closure of the ductus arteriosus with indomethacin in ventilated neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. Effects of pulmonary compliance and ventilation.\n The reported effects of indomethacin on pulmonary compliance are variable depending upon the patient population and on the degree to which indomethacin resulted in successful ductal closure.\n Eleven fluid-restricted, furosemide-treated premature infants being mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who also had a significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) had pulmonary function testing performed before and after successful closure of the PDA.\n The diagnosis of a significant PDA was made by clinical and echocardiographic criteria.\n Indomethacin was administered at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg/dose every 12 to 18 h for 1 to 3 doses.\n To control for the 48-h time interval to achieve ductal closure, nine premature infants being ventilated for RDS but who did not have a significant PDA also had pulmonary function evaluations performed before and after the 48 h.\n Also, to control for the independent effect of fluid restriction and diuretic therapy on pulmonary compliance, eight such premature infants with a PDA had pulmonary function evaluations performed at a 48-h interval.\n Successful closure of the ductus with indomethacin was associated with an improvement in compliance and ventilation parameters in all infants in the indomethacin-treated infants.\n In the indomethacin-treated group, the mean percent improvements were noted in the following parameters: CLdyn, 59.2%; CLI, 78.3%; CLE, 63.3%; VT, 63.3%; VE, 54.6%.\n There were no significant changes in the pulmonary functions in the 48-h RDS or the 48-h PDA fluid-restricted, furosemide-treated control groups.\n In conclusion, successful closure of the ductus with indomethacin causes a significant improvement in compliance and ventilation parameters in infants being mechanically ventilated for RDS.",
