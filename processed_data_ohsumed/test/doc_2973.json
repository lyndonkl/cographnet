  "text": "Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report.\n Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia.\n This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\n Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation.\n A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries.\n Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia.",
