  "text": "A syndrome characterized by nodular eosinophilic infiltration of the skin and immunoglobulin isotype imbalance.\n A 9-year-old boy had recurrent acute, plaquelike, nodular infiltrations with overlying vesicles and bullae of the face and right hand.\n Histologically, the lesions consisted of a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many eosinophils.\n The lesions responded to dapsone therapy.\n Laboratory studies revealed blood eosinophilia, hyperimmunoglobulinemias E and G4, and hypoimmunoglobulinemias M and G1-3, which normalized after treatment.\n The patient's immune deviation is consistent with a transient imbalance of lymphokine production in helper T cells.",
