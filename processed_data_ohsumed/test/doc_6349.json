  "text": "Causes of post-prostatectomy retention.\n Forty-eight patients in urinary retention following prostatectomy underwent urodynamic evaluation.\n Fifteen patients (31%) were found to have persistent residual obstruction, while 14 patients (29%) had detrusor hyporeflexia.\n In 9 patients (19%) a combination of outflow obstruction and detrusor hyporeflexia was demonstrated.\n In 6 patients (13%), urinary retention was due to compromised mental status.\n No abnormality was detected in remaining 4 patients (8%) on urodynamic evaluation.\n For proper evaluation of unsatisfactory voiding after prostatectomy cystoscopy is of limited value while urodynamic testing is essential.",
