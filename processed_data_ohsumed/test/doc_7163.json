  "text": "Chondrons from articular cartilage. III. Morphologic changes in the cellular microenvironment of chondrons isolated from osteoarthritic cartilage.\n Chondrons were isolated from human and canine osteoarthritic cartilage using low-speed homogenization techniques.\n Changes in chondron morphology were evaluated using differential interference-contrast microscopy, phase-contrast microscopy, and histochemical and ultrastructural methods.\n Chondrocyte viability was assessed using fluorescein diacetate staining, and chondron metabolism was investigated using autoradiography.\n The results suggest that initial changes in the collagen and proteoglycan distribution within the chondron are followed by chondrocyte proliferation to form clusters.\n These techniques offer the potential to study cell matrix interactions in degenerative osteoarthritis.",
