  "text": "Naproxen-induced pseudoporphyria: a distinctive photodermatitis.\n A distinctive photodermatitis developed in 22 children who had been receiving naproxen for prolonged periods.\n The eruption was marked by erythema, vesiculation, or increased skin fragility characterized by easy scarring of sun-exposed skin.\n Results of biochemical studies for porphyria were normal, and other causes of photosensitivity were believed to be unlikely.\n Of the 22 patients, 21 had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus.\n Twenty of the patients had fair skin and blue eyes.\n In each case, all findings except scarring resolved when naproxen was discontinued.\n Attention must be paid to complaints suggesting photosensitivity in children receiving naproxen.",
