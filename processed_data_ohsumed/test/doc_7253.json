  "text": "Bone resorption, stability, and soft-tissue changes following large chin advancements.\n Large advancement genioplasties were performed in 10 patients (mean advancement, 11.7 mm) by horizontal osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible, with preservation of a musculoperiosteal pedicle to the advanced genial segment.\n Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and long-term follow-up lateral cephalometric radiographs were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the osseous and soft-tissue changes of the chin.\n After a mean follow-up period of 15 months, 76% of the initial advancement was preserved, representing 24% osseous resorption.\n The enveloping soft tissues of the chin followed the bony movement in a ratio of 1:0.88.\n Horizontal osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible was a relatively stable procedure when used for large chin advancements.\n The broadcast possible musculoperiosteal pedicle should remain attached to the advanced genial segment to minimize osseous resorption and to achieve more predictable soft-tissue changes.",
