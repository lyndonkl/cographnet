  "text": "HTLV-I-associated leukemia/lymphoma in south Florida.\n We report here 10 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) seen in South Florida between February 1988 and July 1989.\n All were seropositive for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).\n DNA extracted from tumor biopsies/peripheral blood lymphocytes of nine patients was shown by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to contain HTLV-I proviral DNA.\n Blot hybridization of DNA extracted from seven patients with an HTLV-I cDNA probe revealed a monoclonal pattern of proviral integration consistent with a diagnosis of ATL.\n Eight of the 10 patients were women.\n Six patients were from Haiti, three from Jamaica, and one from the Bahamas.\n All patients had very aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n Two patients presented with sinus and retro-orbital involvement; another had gastric lymphoma that perforated.\n Nine patients developed hypercalcemia.\n Eight patients died within 1 year of diagnosis.\n Two were lost to follow-up.\n During the course of this study, 66 new cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were diagnosed at this hospital.\n Ten of these cases were ATL.\n The prevalence of HTLV-I-related lymphoma in this sample was 15%.\n Since tissue from all patients was not available for HTLV-I screening, however, it is possible that other cases of ATL went undetected.\n We conclude from this initial survey that a retroviral etiology should be considered in patients from populations known to be at risk for HTLV-I infection who present with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
