  "text": "Renal nerves modulate renin gene expression in the developing rat kidney with ureteral obstruction.\n Chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in newborn rats activates renin gene expression in the obstructed kidney, and increases renin distribution along afferent glomerular arterioles in both kidneys.\n To investigate the role of the renal nerves in this response, 2-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to UUO or sham operation.\n Chemical sympathectomy was performed by injection of guanethidine, whereas, control groups received saline vehicle.\n At 4-5 wk, renal renin distribution was determined by immunocytochemistry, and renin mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot hybridization.\n Compared to the saline-treated rats with UUO, renin remained localized to the juxtaglomerular region in both kidneys of rats with UUO receiving guanethidine (P less than 0.05).\n Moreover, renin mRNA levels were eightfold lower in obstructed kidneys of rats receiving guanethidine than in those receiving saline.\n Additional groups of rats with UUO were subjected to unilateral mechanical renal denervation: renin gene expression in the obstructed kidney was suppressed by ipsilateral but not by contralateral renal denervation.\n These findings indicate that either chemical or mechanical denervation suppressed the increase in renin gene expression of the neonatal kidney with ipsilateral UUO.\n We conclude that the renal sympathetic nerves modulate renin gene expression in the developing kidney with chronic UUO.",
