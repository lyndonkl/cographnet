  "text": "Prune belly syndrome in females: a triad of abdominal musculature deficiency and anomalies of the urinary and genital systems.\n We describe seven female patients with deficient abdominal wall musculature and urinary tract and genital anomalies that represent the female equivalent of the prune belly syndrome.\n Urethral atresia, uterine duplication, and anorectal anomalies occurred frequently.\n The perinatal mortality rate was high; of the four surviving patients, renal failure developed in two and renal transplantation was required.\n The analysis of these cases suggests that urethral obstruction is an important factor contributing to the development of the prune belly syndrome in females.",
