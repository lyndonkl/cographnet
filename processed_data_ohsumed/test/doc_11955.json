  "text": "Hepatic venoocclusive disease in autologous bone marrow transplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas.\n Retrospective review of 291 solid tumor and lymphoma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed to determine the influence of pretransplant characteristics and preparative regimen to the development of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD).\n Twelve patients (4.1%) developed a clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness or hepatomegaly, jaundice, and ascites, with or without encephalopathy, within 40 days of marrow reinfusion.\n Evidence of metastatic liver disease was the only pretransplant characteristic predictive for VOD (P = .0002).\n Sex, age, histology, hepatitis B serology, and elevated liver function tests were not predictive.\n No individual preparative agent had a significant effect on the development of VOD.\n However, a single 2-hour infusion of carmustine (BCNU) (greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2) led to an increased incidence of VOD when compared with the same dose administered in a fractionated schedule (P = .0258) when given with two other chemotherapeutic agents.\n Seven of eight autopsy specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VOD.\n The four patients in whom clinical VOD resolved had lower median peak bilirubins (7.3 v 15.9 mg/dL), lower median peak creatinines (2.1 v 4.1 mg/dL), and relatively quick engraftment of neutrophils (mean, 18.7 days).\n One of the four patients in whom VOD resolved had other grade 4 (life-threatening) toxicities in contrast to eight of eight who succumbed.\n In summary, VOD is an uncommon complication in autotransplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas.\n Our data suggest caution in selecting patients with known metastatic liver disease and consideration of a fractionated BCNU schedule especially in combination with other alkylating agents.",
