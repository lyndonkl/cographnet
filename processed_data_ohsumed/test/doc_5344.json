  "text": "Delayed brachial artery occlusion owing to a dog bite of the upper extremity.\n We report a case of delayed presentation of vascular injury from a superficial dog bite of the upper extremity in a five-year-old male.\n This example of a significant arterial injury, in the setting of seemingly minor trauma, is the first known report of blunt arterial trauma owing to a dog bite in any age group.\n Blunt arterial trauma in children is rare unless associated with fractures, dislocations, or massive crush injuries.\n Additionally, persistent pulses following arterial occlusion are rare and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis of a serious arterial injury.\n A brief review of pediatric blunt vascular injuries is presented with implications for diagnosis and management of such cases.",
