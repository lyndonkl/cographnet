  "text": "Pseudopsammomatous meningioma with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen: a true secretory meningioma. Case report.\n A sphenoid-wing meningioma in a 60-year-old woman was accompanied by elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, which returned to normal after removal of the tumor.\n Light microscopic examination revealed a secretory meningioma containing numerous pseudopsammoma bodies and a prominent vascular pattern.\n Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells and pseudopsammoma bodies to be CEA-positive.\n This case illustrates the possibility that secretory meningioma may be associated with clinically detectable secretion of CEA.\n The report also documents the rare occurrence of elevated serum CEA in a primary benign intracranial tumor.",
