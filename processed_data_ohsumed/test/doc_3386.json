  "text": "Interferon as an agent against herpes simplex virus.\n The effectiveness and limitations of interferon as an antiviral agent in man is exemplified by its actions against herpes simplex types 1 and 2.\n Given in adequate doses parenterally before or shortly after infection, interferon can ameliorate or reduce clinical manifestations or reduce the virus yield.\n It usually cannot completely prevent disease and may be particularly problematical if used late after infection in an acute disease.\n It is ineffective against the state of latent infection in ganglia.\n Interferon may have more potential in slower virus diseases and diseases in which other pathogenetic mechanisms affected by interferon's pleiotropic actions are operative.",
