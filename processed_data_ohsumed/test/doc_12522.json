  "text": "Prenatal findings in Brachmann-de Lange syndrome.\n Brachmann-de Lange syndrome is a congenital disorder of uncertain cause characterized by severe mental retardation, small stature, microbrachycephaly, hirsutism, limb deformities, and characteristic facies.\n Although more than 300 neonatal cases have been reported, a lack of specific fetal markers has precluded successful antepartum diagnosis.\n We describe a case of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome identified at 15 weeks' gestation by a low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) value.\n Sonography revealed a fetus with a posterior nuchal cystic hygroma and early-onset symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).\n The fetal karyotype was 46,XX, but the infant fulfilled the phenotypic criteria of the Brachmann-de Lange syndrome at delivery.\n The triad of an abnormally low MSAFP value, early-onset symmetrical IUGR, and characteristic ultrasound findings during the second trimester of pregnancy may define adequate criteria for prenatal diagnosis of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome.",
