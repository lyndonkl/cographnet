  "text": "Capsular genu syndrome.\n We report 5 patients with unilateral infarct and 1 with hemorrhage limited to the genu of the internal capsule.\n The most prominent finding was contralateral facial and lingual hemiparesis with dysarthria.\n Three patients also showed unilateral mastication-palatal-pharyngeal weakness, and 1 had unilateral vocal cord paresis.\n Mild limb involvement was limited to hand weakness in 4 patients.\n Our findings suggest that the majority of motor corticopontine and corticocobulbar fibers are located in the genu of the internal capsule.\n The faciolingual syndrome and its variants are highly suggestive of capsular genu stroke.",
