  "text": "Cytogenetic analysis of a granulocytic sarcoma in a patient without systemic leukaemia.\n Granulocytic sarcoma is a rare complication of leukaemia.\n Occasionally it presents before the development of systemic leukaemia when diagnosis may be difficult.\n A case of granulocytic sarcoma occurring in a patient with no overt evidence of leukaemia, but in whom cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow showed a clonal t(12;13) translocation, is reported.\n Cytogenetic analysis of tissues in this disease may indicate evidence of systemic disease before overt morphological changes.",
