  "text": "Evaluation of a perinatal autopsy protocol: influence of the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team.\n This study was designed to evaluate changes in the perinatal autopsy following the adoption of a new autopsy protocol.\n The University of Utah Medical Center has a Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team composed of obstetricians, pediatricians, geneticists, and other health care professionals.\n These individuals are involved in the care of patients whose pregnancies are at risk for congenital malformations.\n An autopsy protocol was designed to increase the interaction of the pathologist with the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team in the evaluation of perinatal death.\n Two years, 1982 and 1987, before and after the protocol was implemented, were selected for retrospective review.\n The autopsies in 1987 made more specific diagnoses compared with those in 1982.\n Additional congenital anomalies were diagnosed, and increased numbers of patients were found to have well-described congenital disorders.\n The number of attempted postnatal autopsy chromosome studies increased and more chromosomal abnormalities were detected.\n The final autopsy diagnoses made in 1987 have provided more information to the physician for genetic or other patient counseling.\n After the protocol was adopted, increased numbers of cases were referred to the Medical Center for evaluation at autopsy.\n More of those who came to autopsy had been evaluated during life by members of the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team.\n Premortem sonograms had been done at an earlier gestational age and a greater number of anomalies were detected.\n Fewer of the fetuses had intrauterine death and more had pregnancy terminated by induction of labor.\n The gestational age at delivery declined.",
