  "text": "Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis.\n In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements.\n This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful.\n The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals.\n Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research.",
