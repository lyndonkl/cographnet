  "text": "Prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathies. II. Evaluation of counseling \n Learning during genetic counseling is often below expectations, especially in the context of genetic screening.\n In this report we describe learning as a result of genetic counseling of 298 pregnant women identified as hemoglobinopathy carriers, 234 with sickle cell trait and 64 with beta-thalassemia trait.\n Counseling was designed to provide the information needed in a simple, clear, and nondirective manner.\n A special videotape produced for this purpose provided dramatization and a role model illustrating an appropriate response.\n After viewing the videotape the counselee had an opportunity to question the counselor and to have any misconceptions corrected.\n Questionnaires revealed significantly increased knowledge as a result of counseling in each of the three hemoglobinopathy subject areas tested-namely, clinical manifestations, genetics, and prenatal diagnosis.\n Five factors correlated with higher knowledge scores after counseling-namely, a younger patient age, more years of education, knowledge of having trait before this identification, knowledge of the baby's father having trait before counseling, and having no prior children.",
