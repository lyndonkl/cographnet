  "text": "Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis in two neutropenic patients.\n Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is an uncommon, self-limited dermatosis with a variable clinical presentation.\n It seems to be due to chemotherapeutic drugs in most cases.\n Necrosis of the eccrine gland associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate is the histologic hallmark of this disease.\n We report two additional cases in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in which there was a striking lack of neutrophil infiltration.\n A new term, drug-associated eccrine hidradenitis, is suggested.",
