  "text": "Results and complications of angioplasty in aortoiliac disease \n Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used to treat 340 aortoiliac lesions in 200 patients who were followed for as long as 90 months (mean, 28.7 months; median, 23 months).\n The initial success rate was 94.7% for lesions and 93.0% for patients.\n The indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty included claudication in 117 patients (58.5%), rest pain or ischemic night pain in 47 (23.5%), limb salvage in 33 (16.5%), and aiding in wound healing in three (1.5%).\n In the series, 70% of the patients had two or more cardiovascular risk factors.\n Angioplasty was initially unsuccessful in 14 patients, and 10 patients were lost to follow-up.\n Follow-up was obtained in 176 patients.\n The long-term results were analyzed using the life table method to determine cumulative patency.\n Fourteen patients were considered failures because of recurrent disease or symptoms.\n The projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 85%.\n When the response to redilatation was considered, the projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 92%.\n The results indicate that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can successfully correct aortoiliac lesions and provide a long-term benefit for as long as 7.5 years.",
