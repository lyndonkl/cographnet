  "text": "Clinical and anatomic considerations for surgery in femoropopliteal disease and the results of surgery.\n From 1980 to 1988 we performed 288 femoropopliteal bypass operations in 231 patients at the Oregon Health Sciences University.\n The indication for the procedure was claudication in 31% and the relief of limb-threatening ischemia in 64%.\n Operative mortality occurred after four of these operations (1.4%), including three deaths from myocardial infarction and one death from stroke.\n The femoropopliteal bypass patients were divided into groups for patency analysis, including those undergoing bypass surgery with a good quality greater saphenous vein versus alternate bypass conduits and patients undergoing primary limb bypass versus those undergoing repeat bypass after prior bypass failure.\n Our overall primary graft patency for all femoropopliteal grafts was 79% at 5 years.\n Patients undergoing bypass with a good quality greater saphenous vein had primary graft patency of 85% at 5 years.\n Patients undergoing bypass using a conduit other than greater saphenous vein had a 5-year patency of 73%.\n Patients undergoing repeat bypass after a prior failed bypass had a 5-year patency of 57%.",
