  "text": "Translumbar arch aortography: a retrospective controlled study of usefulness, technique, and safety.\n Subclavian and axillary artery stenoses may lead to axillofemoral bypass graft failure.\n These arteries were assessed preoperatively with arch aortography performed after conventional high translumbar peripheral aortography by exchanging the initial 16-gauge sheath for a 5-F pigtail catheter.\n Thirty-two diagnostic translumbar runoff and arch (TLR-arch) aortograms were obtained in 30 patients with advanced lower extremity ischemia.\n In six patients (20%), the results of the arch study influenced the choice of an inflow site.\n These patients were compared with 70 control subjects who underwent conventional translumbar aortography without arch studies.\n In the TLR-arch group, two major complications occurred in one patient, while in the control group 11 major complications occurred in 10 patients.\n One retroperitoneal hematoma occurred in the TLR-arch group; two occurred in the control group.\n The mean change in hematocrit for the TLR-arch group was -3.81% (-0.0381), and for the control group it was -4.17% (-0.0417).\n This difference was not statistically significant.\n Arch aortography is a valuable adjunct to the translumbar aortofemoral study.\n It can be simply performed without increasing the morbidity of the peripheral study.",
