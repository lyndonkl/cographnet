  "text": "Interleukin-6 and its receptor are expressed by human megakaryocytes: in vitro effects on proliferation and endoreplication.\n Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in the megakaryocytic differentiation.\n Recently, we have observed that IL-6 is synthesized by several human cell lines with megakaryocytic features.\n In this study, we have investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs during normal megakaryocytic differentiation.\n Human megakaryocytes (MK) were obtained by culturing normal marrow in liquid culture with aplastic plasma (AP).\n First, an IL-6 secretion in bone marrow culture enriched in MK as well as in purified MK populations was demonstrated by a biologic assay.\n Second, IL-6 mRNA was detected in a purified population of MK by the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot analysis.\n IL-6 mRNA and protein were undetectable in platelets.\n Third, in situ hybridization procedure demonstrated the presence of IL-6 mRNA in individual immature MK.\n Fourth, IL-6 protein was detected in MK at the unicellular level by an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6.\n Furthermore, the presence of IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) on MK was demonstrated by in situ hybridization using an IL-6-R probe and in situ autoradiography after binding with [125I]-labeled recombinant IL-6.\n The IL-6 endogenously produced in liquid cultures containing normal human plasma or AP was subsequently neutralized.\n This resulted in a 50% decrease of the MK growth with a minor shift in the ploidy distribution toward lower values.\n In semisolid cultures the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies led to a 42% decrease in colony number in cultures stimulated by IL-3 but not in other conditions of culture.\n These results suggest that normal human megakaryocytopoiesis might be regulated in part by an IL-6 autocrine loop.",
