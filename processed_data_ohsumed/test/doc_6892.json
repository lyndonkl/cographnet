  "text": "Abnormal function of CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes in a patient with widespread human papillomavirus type 3-related infection.\n Human papillomavirus-induced infections may be associated with cellular immunodeficiency.\n However, very little is known about the dysfunctional interactions among T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and antigen-presenting cells.\n A 30-year-old heterosexual man with a 10-year history of persistent multiple refractory flat wart lesions containing human papillomavirus type 3-related DNA sequence was studied.\n The patient had a severe depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and a compensatory increase in the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes.\n Impaired T-lymphocyte response to various stimuli was found.\n Depletion of the increased number of CD8+ T lymphocytes, which suppressed immunoglobulin production in vitro, did not restore the impaired T-lymphocyte response.\n Immobilized anti-CD3 beads that stimulate the T lymphocyte antigen complex in the absence of antigen-presenting cells indicated a T-lymphocyte defect, rather than a decreased antigen-presenting cell function.\n Thus, the pronounced cellular immunodeficiency was due to abnormal function of the CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes.",
