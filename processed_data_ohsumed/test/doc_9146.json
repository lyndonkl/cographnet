  "text": "Muscle rehabilitation in impaired elderly nursing home residents.\n Based on observations of changes in muscle function associated with aging, and the exacerbation of these changes with frailty, a program of muscle strengthening has been developed to correct specific defects in muscles.\n This pilot study was undertaken on 18 functionally impaired nursing home residents (age range 60 to 90 years) with markedly deteriorated muscle function (50%) secondary to age, disuse, and multiple chronic illnesses.\n Fourteen of the subjects completed the six-week program without adverse effects.\n In 75% of the patients, there was improved muscle function, with endurance, strength, and speed increasing 35%, 15%, and 10%, respectively.\n After the program, many subjects increased their spontaneous activity and decreased their dependency.\n The improvements were still evident four months after rehabilitation.\n These results suggest that it may be possible, through a carefully supervised, short-term program of muscle rehabilitation, for nursing home residents to achieve an enhanced level of physical functioning.",
