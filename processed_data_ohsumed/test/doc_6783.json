  "text": "Erythropoietin response to anemia as a function of age.\n The erythropoietin (EPO) response to anemia was assessed for 244 subjects aged 1-64 years (mean 45.2 years) and 121 subjects aged 65-94 years (mean 68.3 years).\n Subjects included non-anemic individuals as well as those with anemia of various etiologies, excluding renal disease and pregnancy.\n Significant inverse correlations between serum immunoreactive EPO and hematocrit were noted for both groups.\n Regression lines failed to show a significantly lower slope or y-intercept for older compared to younger subjects.\n EPO levels were not significantly lower for older compared to younger subjects when controlled for hematocrit level.\n These results suggest that the EPO response to anemia in older subjects is similar to that of younger subjects.",
