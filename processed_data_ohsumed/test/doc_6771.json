  "text": "Platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma and whole blood in 120 patients with myeloproliferative disorders.\n In vitro platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and in whole blood (WB) was assessed in 31 patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, 32 with essential thrombocytosis, 23 with polycythemia vera, and 34 with chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n In PRP most subjects showed normal or reduced platelet aggregation, whereas in WB the majority of patients showed increased platelet function.\n Spontaneous platelet aggregation (SPA) was observed frequently in WB, whereas it was seldom observed in PRP.\n SPA in WB was inhibited by in vitro addition of aspirin and apyrase, and SPA was only partially dependent on high platelet count because it also occurred in samples with normal platelet content (at variance with 13 subjects with reactive thrombocytosis, in which SPA was observed only in samples with high platelet concentration).\n Platelets from patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis had the highest tendency to undergo SPA.",
