  "text": "Serum leukotriene B4 levels in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease.\n Leukotriene B4 has been found to be increased in the serum of cigarette smokers and some patients with bronchial asthma, as well as in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis and COPD.\n Corticosteroids supposedly may block the formation of LTB4.\n To determine if the effect of CS on airway disease is by reduction in LTB4, we studied serum LTB4 levels in clinically stable patients with asthma or COPD who were treated with or without CS.\n The LTB4 was extracted from serum and assayed by radioimmunoassay.\n Serum LTB4 concentrations, expressed as the mean +/- SD, were 0.36 +/- 0.15 ng/ml in ten normal controls, 0.56 +/- 0.18 ng/ml in nine asthmatic subjects, 0.67 +/- 0.2 ng/ml in eight asthmatic subjects receiving CS, 0.81 +/- 0.19 ng/ml in seven patients with COPD, and 0.97 +/- 0.29 ng/ml in eight patients with COPD receiving CS.\n Serum LTB4 levels in normal controls differed significantly from all groups with COPD or asthma (p less than 0.01).\n Levels of LTB4 in asthmatic subjects differed from levels in patients with COPD (p less than 0.03), and levels in asthmatic subjects receiving CS differed from subjects with COPD receiving CS (p less than 0.03).\n Concentrations of LTB4 within either the COPD or the asthmatic groups were not lower in the patients treated with CS.\n We conclude that serum LTB4 concentrations are higher in COPD than in asthma or normal controls and that administration of CS is not associated with low LTB4 levels.\n The beneficial effects of CS in obstructive airway disease appear to be mediated by mechanisms other than reduction of LTB4.",
