  "text": "Elevated serum aluminum levels in severely burned patients who are receiving large quantities of albumin.\n Aluminum contaminates various fluids that are used in intravenous therapy, and it is associated with bone disease and encephalopathy.\n Albumin is highly contaminated with aluminum, which is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.\n Patients with burns receive large quantities of albumin and have impaired renal function, which puts them at hypothetical risk for aluminum loading.\n To assess the risk of aluminum loading we analyzed sera from 12 patients with burns for aluminum concentrations.\n Serum aluminum concentration was elevated in 8 of the 12 patients, and levels were at or near toxicity in 3 of the 8.\n Serum aluminum and serum creatinine levels directly correlated, r = 0.71 and p less than 0.005.\n No relation was found between serum aluminum and amount of albumin received.\n However, patients with the highest serum aluminum levels were the most severely burned and none survived.\n Thus patients with burns who are receiving albumin are at risk for aluminum loading.\n Impaired renal function contributes to aluminum retention.",
