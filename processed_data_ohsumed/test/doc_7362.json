  "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging of sacroiliac joint inflammation.\n A consecutive series of 27 patients with symptoms compatible with sacroiliitis underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints.\n The diagnostic sensitivity of MRI was similar to that of computed tomography or conventional radiography.\n However, MRI seems to have the potential of providing unique information about the disease process in sacroiliitis by demonstrating abnormalities in subchondral bone and periarticular bone marrow.\n The results of this study suggest that early inflammatory changes in sacroiliitis occur in the subchondral structures of the sacroiliac joints.",
