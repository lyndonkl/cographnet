  "text": "Quantitative and qualitative platelet abnormalities during pregnancy.\n In a 1-year period, 15 of 4048 pregnant women were found to have thrombocytopenia during their first prenatal visit.\n Their qualitative and quantitative platelet abnormalities were followed up prospectively for 1 to 6 months post partum.\n Platelet counts returned to normal in 14 of 15 patients 4 to 6 weeks post partum.\n von Willebrand factor antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were low in three of 15 patients 4 to 6 weeks post partum, but had been normal during the antepartum period.\n Two of these three patients had prolonged bleeding times ante partum and post partum.\n All three patients subsequently were found to have mild type I von Willebrand disease.\n Six patients had detectable platelet antibodies.\n Neonatal thrombocytopenia was found in one term infant of a patient with mild thrombocytopenia and negative platelet antibodies.\n This study suggests that mild, transient, isolated thrombocytopenia can occur in an otherwise normal pregnancy and its incidence may be lower than previously reported.\n Extensive testing is not indicated unless there is an associated prolonged bleeding time.\n The possibility of von Willebrand disease or a qualitative platelet disorder should be considered.",
