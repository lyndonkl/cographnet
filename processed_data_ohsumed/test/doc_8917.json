  "text": "Endoscopic laser surgery for early glottic carcinoma: a clinical and experimental study.\n The purpose of this study is to define the indications for using the CO2 laser for the treatment of early glottic cancer.\n For this purpose, 52 consecutive laser resections of Tis to T2 vocal cord carcinomas were studied prospectively.\n In addition, laser resection was performed in eight human cadaver larynges, which were then examined histologically using whole organ sections.\n Both tumor size and tumor location had important influences on tumor resectability by laser.\n All of the Tis, 78% of T1, and one of four T2 carcinomas were successfully treated by laser surgery alone.\n Of the 10 carcinomas involving the anterior commissure, only four could completely be resected with the laser; of these four, two recurred in the anterior commissure.\n This finding is corroborated by the histologic study, which clearly shows that anterior commissure resection poses problems.\n The only laser resection complication of early glottic cancer was persistent hoarseness in one third of the patients.\n It is concluded that CO2 laser resection is a safe and effective alternative treatment for patients with Tis and T1 glottic carcinoma, provided the anterior commissure is free of tumor.",
