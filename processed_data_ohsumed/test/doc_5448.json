  "text": "Saccular aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery.\n We report a series of 42 consecutive patients with aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA).\n Of these, 36 patients had one aneurysm, 5 had two aneurysms, and one had three aneurysms.\n Thirty patients had a ruptured distal ACA aneurysm; among these patients, the size of the aneurysm was less than 5 mm in diameter in 20, 6 to 10 mm in 7, and larger than 11 mm in 3.\n Eighteen patients (42.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and distal ACA aneurysms were responsible for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 10.\n Thirty-four patients underwent direct surgery, and 30 of these had excellent outcomes 3 months after surgery.\n The treatment of patients with distal ACA aneurysms is often technically difficult, because of their broad neck configuration and the coexistence of other aneurysms.\n Nevertheless, the present study emphasizes that distal ACA aneurysms tend to bleed, irrespective of their size, and that excellent outcomes are obtainable by direct surgery.",
