  "text": "Atelectasis affects the rate of arterial desaturation during obstructive apnea.\n Chronic hemodynamic disturbances are more profound in patients with obstructive sleep apnea when underlying lung disease with abnormal gas exchange (low arterial PO2) is present.\n Previous studies suggest that pulmonary gas exchange could influence the rate of fall of arterial oxygen saturation (dSaO2/dt) in obstructive sleep apnea.\n We postulated that abnormal gas exchange in the form of atelectasis would steepen dSaO2/dt and thereby lower nadir arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) for the same duration of apnea.\n Apneas were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at end expiration in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons.\n Apneas of the same duration were then repeated during temporary endobronchial occlusion of one lobe of the lung.\n SaO2 and mixed venous O2 saturation were continuously monitored, and cardiac output was calculated.\n Worsening of pulmonary gas exchange during atelectasis was documented by an increase in calculated venous admixture from 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 25.0 +/- 0.7% (P less than 0.001).\n The dSaO2/dt was independent of apnea duration at 30, 45, and 60 s.\n During endobronchial occlusion, apnea dSaO2/dt increased 20%, and nadir SaO2 was significantly lower.\n Possible mechanisms for steepening of dSaO2/dt during atelectasis are discussed.",
