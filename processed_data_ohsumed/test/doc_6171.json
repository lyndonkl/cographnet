  "text": "Acute glomerulonephritis in a patient with Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\n It is generally assumed that acute tubular necrosis is the etiology of renal failure that can occur during the course of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF).\n However, histologic examination of kidneys has been mainly limited to autopsy cases of fulminant infections.\n Acute glomerulonephritis due to glomerular immune complex deposition has not been reported in RMSF.\n We describe a case of acute oliguric renal failure that developed more than 2 weeks following the onset of RMSF.\n Renal biopsy showed acute glomerulonephritis with inflammatory cell infiltration and subendothelial immune deposits.\n Thus, acute glomerulonephritis should be in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure that occurs in RMSF.",
