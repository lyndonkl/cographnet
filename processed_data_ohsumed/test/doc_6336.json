  "text": "Symptom analysis of patients undergoing modified Pereyra bladder neck suspension for stress urinary incontinence. Pre- and postoperative findings.\n The results of a physician-directed follow-up of 145 women undergoing the modified Pereyra bladder neck suspension from March 1980 to February 1986 are presented.\n Median follow-up was 3.5 years (2.0-7.7); 70 percent of patients had follow-up between three and four years postoperatively.\n All patients had preoperative demonstration of stress incontinence as well as urodynamic evaluation.\n Fifty-one percent of patients reported no stress incontinence and 76 percent reported that their sense of urinary control was better, or much better at the time of follow-up.\n Improvement was seen in all grades of stress incontinence.\n Age, weight, parity, and history of prior anti-incontinence surgery had no significant impact on success rates.\n Although preoperative urgency symptoms were more common among failure (28% vs 15%), this association was not statistically significant.\n However, persistent or de novo urgency symptoms postoperatively were highly associated with postoperative incontinence (p less than 0.005).\n The onset of recurrent incontinence was experienced more than two years postoperatively in 23 percent of the incontinent group.",
