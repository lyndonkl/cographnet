  "text": "The clinical implications of subchorionic placental lucencies.\n Forty-six patients were identified at a perinatal diagnostic referral center as having subchorionic placental lucencies.\n These lucencies varied from simple to multicystic and covered up to 50% of the subchorionic placental surface.\n Clinical follow-up of 40 patients demonstrated no increase in the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome.\n We conclude that these pregnancies are not at higher risk when the subchorionic placental lucencies are not associated with other intraplacental or fetal anomalies.",
