  "text": "Cochlear otosclerosis: statistical analysis of relationship of spiral ligament hyalinization to hearing loss.\n This paper presents an analysis of the relationship of the amount of hyalinization of the spiral ligament, secondary to cochlear otosclerosis (spongiosis), to the amount of hearing loss.\n This relationship was previously studied by Parahy and Linthicum.\n It was found that the larger the amount of hyalinization, the greater the hearing loss.\n This hyalinization is a measure of the amount of toxic enzymes being excreted into the inner ear fluid.\n These enzymes are suspected to affect the metabolic function of the hair cells.",
