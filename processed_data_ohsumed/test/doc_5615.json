  "text": "Interferon-alpha receptor expression and regulation in chronic hepatitis B virus infection.\n Interferon-alpha elicits antiviral and immunoregulatory activities by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface.\n In this study, binding characteristics of interferon-alpha to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were studied using radioiodinated recombinant interferon-alpha 2b to determine interferon-alpha receptor numbers and dissociation constants.\n A single class of interferon-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets.\n Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (n = 20) and controls (n = 16) expressed a similar number of interferon-alpha receptors (484 +/- 175 vs.\n 511 +/- 168 sites/cell respectively, p = NS) with a similar dissociation constant (dissociation constant approximately 0.2 to 0.7 nmol/L).\n Expression of interferon-alpha receptors was similar in monocyte-enriched and lymphocyte-enriched fractions in both groups.\n Similar changes were observed in patients receiving alpha-interferon therapy.\n There was no correlation between interferon-alpha receptors expression and serum transaminase, serum HBsAg, serum HBV DNA, liver histological findings or the response to interferon-alpha therapy.\n After incubation of lymphocytes in vitro with interferon-alpha 2b (10 to 1,000 U/ml), interferon-alpha receptors number dropped by 42% to 80%, but this was associated with an increase in binding affinity (dissociation constant approximately 0.05 to 0.15 nmol/L) in both patients and controls.\n There was significant delay in the initial phase of receptor recovery in the patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection compared with normal controls (days 1 and 2, p less than 0.05).",
