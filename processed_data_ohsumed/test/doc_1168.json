  "text": "Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia.\n An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria.\n In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain.\n Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria.\n On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins.\n This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria.\n Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria.",
