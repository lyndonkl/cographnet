  "text": "Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery in the treatment of metastatic colon carcinoma. Preliminary results.\n Cryosurgery, the in situ freezing of cancer, has been proposed in the past as a possible treatment for unresectable hepatic tumors.\n Its advantage lies in the fact that it is a very focal treatment sacrificing less normal tissue than surgical resection, allowing treatment of multiple lobes.\n Because cryosurgery does not affect large vessels, tumors in difficult locations, such as adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC), can be treated.\n With the use of intraoperative ultrasound to place the cryoprobes and monitor the freezing process, 18 patients with unresectable metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver were treated.\n Of the 18 patients treated, 4 (22%) are in complete remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scans and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with a mean follow-up of 28.8 months.\n Four patients (22%) were not adequately treated at the time of cryosurgery.\n The number of lesions frozen in each patient ranged from 1 to 12, with a mean of 6 lesions.\n Fourteen patients had bilobar disease; three patients had previous right lobectomies with recurrences in their remaining left lobes prior to cryosurgery, and one patient had unilobar disease.\n Mean survival of the 14 cases with recurrence was 21.4 months, with 2 of the 14 still alive.\n Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery appears to be an effective treatment for metastatic colon carcinoma to the liver that is unresectable (including patients with bilobar and multiple lesions).\n These preliminary results indicate that the procedure warrants further study.",
