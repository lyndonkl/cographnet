  "text": "Prostate cancer: local staging with endorectal surface coil MR imaging.\n Endorectal surface coil magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to stage the local extent of prostate cancer in 22 patients.\n The endorectal coil images were acquired with a 10-12-cm field of view and a 4-mm section thickness.\n All pathologic specimens were reviewed by one pathologist.\n Endorectal surface coil MR imaging was 82% accurate in the differentiation of stage B from stage C cancer.\n One case was overestimated, and three cases were underestimated.\n The three underestimated cases consisted of two cases of microscopic capsular invasion and one case of minimal seminal vesicle invasion.\n In a comparison of retrospective, blinded readings of endorectal coil and body coil images, there was an average improvement in accuracy of 16% in staging prostate cancer with endorectal coil images.",
