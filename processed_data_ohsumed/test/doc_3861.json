  "text": "Multifocal colitis associated with an epidemic of chronic diarrhea.\n An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois.\n Seventy-two individuals were affected.\n Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak.\n Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation.\n Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40).\n Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism.\n Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content.\n Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal.\n Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea.\n Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients.\n Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles.\n After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea.\n One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years.\n We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis.\n This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea.",
