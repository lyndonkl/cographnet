  "text": "Multidisciplinary treatment of primary orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. A single-institution experience.\n Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma accounts for one-fourth of the primary tumors in the head and neck region.\n Modern treatment modalities have led to a 2-year survival rate of about 90% in these patients.\n However, new therapeutic trials are designed to reduce complications and salvage more than 90% of orbital cases.\n Between 1979 and 1990, 12 children affected by primary orbital rhabdomyosarcoma have been diagnosed and treated at the University of Naples.\n Ten of them have been uniformly treated by biopsy, followed by immediate radiation and combined chemotherapy.\n All 12 patients are alive and free of detectable disease, from a minimum of 7 months to a maximum of 123 months after diagnosis.\n In all children, ocular structures have been spared and the complications observed until now have been few.\n The above results suggest that the association of immediate radiation therapy and chemotherapy might represent an optimal tool for treatment of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma.",
