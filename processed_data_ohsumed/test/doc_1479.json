  "text": "Effect of rifabutin on disseminated Mycobacterium avium infections in thymectomized, CD4 T-cell-deficient mice.\n Disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection is the major cause of bacteremia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n We present here a new animal model of this disease, thymectomized C57BL/6 mice that were intravenously infused with monoclonal antibody to selectively deplete CD4+ T cells.\n The increased susceptibility of such animals to M.\n avium infection is comparable to that of C57BL/6 beige mice and thus may provide a viable alternative to the latter model.\n Further, using representative strains of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated M.\n avium (serotypes 1, 4, and 8 and a rough isolate), we show that the course of such infections in thymectomized, CD4-deficient mice can be markedly restrained and in some cases the infections can be sterilized by treatment over a 120-day period with a regimen containing 40 mg of the new antimycobacterial agent rifabutin per kg (body weight).",
