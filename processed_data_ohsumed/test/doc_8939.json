  "text": "Nonspecific magnetic resonance appearance of renal oncocytomas: report of 3 cases and review of the literature.\n We report the magnetic resonance appearance of 3 cases of solitary renal oncocytomas.\n All lesions were of low to moderate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and became considerably brighter on the more heavily T2-weighted images.\n One lesion contained a large central area of cystic degeneration, while the other 2 were solid.\n A central stellate scar was present in the smaller of the 2 solid lesions.\n Our observations lend further support to earlier reports on the nonspecific magnetic resonance features of oncocytomas.",
