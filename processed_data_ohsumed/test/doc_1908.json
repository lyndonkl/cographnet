  "text": "A pilot study of pemirolast in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.\n Pemirolast is a potent, long-acting, orally effective antiallergic agent evaluated for clinical activity in prevention of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.\n It was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group in season trials to test its safety, tolerance, and prophylactic activity.\n Thirty-one patients with a history of fall seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated for 6 weeks with pemirolast, 50 mg bid, or placebo beginning approximately 2 weeks before the onset of the ragweed season in Atlanta.\n Daily evaluation of symptom scores disclosed statistically significantly less sneezing, rhinorrhea, and stuffy nose during treatment with pemirolast.\n There was, however, no difference for other evaluated symptoms or for the use of rescue medicines.\n There were no side effects during this short study.\n This preliminary study indicates that pemirolast may warrant further evaluation for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.",
