  "text": "Poloxamer 407 as an intraperitoneal barrier material for the prevention of postsurgical adhesion formation and reformation in rodent models for reproductive surgery.\n Comtemporary adhesion-prevention regimens for infertility surgery emphasize the use of barrier materials to effect physical separation of injured surfaces before reperitonealization.\n Poloxamer 407 is a biocompatible polymer that displays reverse thermal gelation characteristics; that is, the material exists as a liquid at room temperature and as a solid at body temperature.\n These properties make it an ideal material for use in laparoscopic surgery.\n The antiadhesion properties of poloxamer 407 were evaluated in two models.\n In the first experiment, Golden hamsters were subjected to a standardized adhesion-producing lesion in the left uterine horn.\n Poloxamer solutions in concentrations ranging from 15-35% were applied to the injured horn.\n Location, thickness, and extent of adhesion formation were assessed 14 days later.\n Significant reduction in post-traumatic adhesion formation was observed following treatment with the 30-35% solutions.\n The second experiment was designed as a paradigm of the typical situation encountered in infertility surgery: prevention of adhesion reformation after lysis of established adhesions.\n New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to three laparotomies at 14-day intervals for placement of the adhesion-producing lesion, evaluation (prescore) and surgical lysis of induced adhesions, and subsequent evaluation of adhesion reformation (post-score).\n The effect of applying poloxamer 407 after adhesiotomy was compared with controls (no treatment).\n Adhesion reformation (post-score) was markedly reduced by poloxamer-407 treatment.\n Further trials of this material in the clinical setting are indicated.",
