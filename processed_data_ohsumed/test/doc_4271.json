  "text": "The clinical course of residual carotid arterial disease.\n Over a 5-year period 642 patients underwent 686 carotid endarterectomies with patch closure and intraoperative surveillance with continuous-wave Doppler.\n The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5%.\n Patients were screened with duplex scans immediately after operation for the presence of residual carotid lesions, and followed every 3 to 6 months for either the development of a true recurrent lesion or a change in a residual one.\n Five hundred thirty-nine arteries (84%) had no postoperative abnormalities.\n The incidence of recurrent carotid lesions in this groups was 1.5%, 3.4%, and 5.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively.\n The incidence of symptoms in this group was 0.2%, 0.7%, and 1.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively.\n The earliest recurrence or symptom occurred 8 months from operation.\n One hundred forty-seven arteries had residual lesions that were more common when either a temporary shunt was used or the operation was carried out above the hypoglossal nerve or below the omohyoid muscle.\n Sixty-one patients who had plaque proximal to the arteriotomy without a significant stenosis were followed an average of 21 months.\n There were no changes in plaque morphology and no proven symptoms related to the residual lesion.\n Fifty-six patients with both plaque and significant hemodynamic abnormalities in the carotid bulb were followed an average of 18 months.\n Seven of these patients (12.5%) had either a significant deterioration of the lesion or a symptom from it.\n Each event occurred within 6 months of operation.\n Thirty patients had significant flow abnormalities but no visible plaque.\n None of these lesions deteriorated.\n Although common, residual carotid lesions are benign unless the lesion is characterized by both plaque within the artery and a hemodynamically significant stenosis.\n These lesions should be further investigated and treated when discovered.",
