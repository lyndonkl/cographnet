  "text": "Acridine orange fluorescent microscopy and the detection of malaria in populations with low-density parasitemia.\n Detection of low-density malaria parasites with Giemsa-stained thick smears (G-TS) requires time and experience and becomes impractical with high sample loads.\n Acridine orange fluorescent microscopy (AO/FM) of capillary centrifuged blood may offer an alternative technique.\n We compared AO/FM readings with G-TS in 290 specimens from asymptomatic people in Thai villages endemic for malaria.\n AO/FM specimens were prepared in modified capillary tubes coated with acridine orange (Quantitative Buffy Coat or \"QBC tubes\") and examined under a fluorescent microscope.\n Twenty-three (85.2%) of the 27 specimens found positive by G-TS had under 100 parasites/microliters blood (less than 35 parasites/200 microscopic fields).\n The overall AO/FM sensitivity was 78.9% [range: 66.7% (10/15)-86.7% (13/15)].\n For Plasmodium falciparum, regardless of stages, the sensitivities varied from 66.7% (8/12) to 91.7% (11/12).\n AO/FM performed better for P.\n falciparum than for Plasmodium vivax and for asexual than for sexual stages of the parasite.\n However, the species- and stage-specific results must be interpreted with caution because of the small sample sizes and very low parasite densities involved.\n The test specificity was 96.6% [range: 95.6% (263/275)-97.1% (263/271)].\n These levels of accuracy plus the known advantages of AO/FM suggest that the test, supplemented with G-TS to improve species and stage differentiation, is also useful for screening low-density parasitemias.",
