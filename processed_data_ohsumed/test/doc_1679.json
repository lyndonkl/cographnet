  "text": "A rabbit model for bacteria-induced preterm pregnancy loss.\n Bacterial infection has been implicated in premature labor in humans.\n To elucidate mechanisms and potential intervention strategies, we sought to develop a model of infection-induced pregnancy loss in rabbits.\n On day 21 (70% of gestation), each uterine horn was inoculated hysteroscopically with 0.2 ml containing saline solution of 10(6) cfu Escherichia coli or Bacteroides bivius or Fusobacterium necrophorum.\n Fetal viability was assessed.\n Animals were sacrificed at various times or as delivery occurred.\n Serum progesterone and amniotic fluid prostaglandins were measured.\n Cultures and histologic sections were prepared.\n Compared with the saline solution group, E coli and F.\n necrophorum-inoculated rabbits were significantly more likely to deliver (16 of 16 and six of seven with mean times of 31.9 +/- 10.7 and 28.3 +/- 11.5 hours, respectively for E.\n coli and F.\n necrophorum).\n Positive amniotic fluid cultures for the E.\n coli group were found in 11 of 12 (92%) and for the F.\n necrophorum group in three of three cases (100%).\n Histologic inflammation was seen heavily in both the E.\n coli and F.\n necrophorum groups, whereas it was absent in the saline solution group.\n Inoculation with B.\n bivius led to a much lower pregnancy loss rate (eight of 32) and less histologic inflammation despite positive uterine cultures in most animals.\n This model may provide an opportunity to determine mechanisms of clinical or subclinical intraamniotic infection and to test intervention strategies.",
