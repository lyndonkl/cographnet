  "text": "Roentgenographic evaluation of the augmented breast.\n We performed a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer arising in women with augmented breasts.\n Of eight women with breast implants in whom breast cancer developed, six had mammograms before biopsy.\n Only two of the six cancers were identified mammographically (sensitivity = 33%), and one of these two was seen only in retrospect.\n In both cases, the mammographic findings suggested a benign rather than a malignant process.\n All eight women had a palpable mass and early disease, and all are clinically disease-free at present.\n The sensitivity of mammography in detecting palpable cancers in a control group of women without implants was 92% (118 of 128).\n For tumors of 2 cm or less, the sensitivity was 88% (58 of 66).\n These results suggest that the sensitivity of mammography in detecting breast cancer is decreased when implants are present.\n Further investigations are needed to determine the effects of prostheses on mammographic evaluations.",
