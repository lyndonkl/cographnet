  "text": "Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the limbs.\n Limb anomalies and their commonly associated organ malformations are increasingly recognized in fetal life because of the use of high resolution real-time sonography.\n In most instances plain radiography establishes the diagnosis of limb anomalies shortly after birth.\n In some neonates the diagnosis is tentative until full skeletal maturity is attained.\n When evaluation of the soft tissues and unmineralized cartilage or ossification center is a prerequisite to early definitive therapy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the procedures of choice.",
