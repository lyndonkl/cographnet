  "text": "Mycobacterium chelonei keratopathy with visual rehabilitation by a triple procedure.\n We report a chronic keratouveitis following an eye injury, the etiology of which remained obscure despite repeated corneal scrapings and cultures.\n Eventually, the diagnosis was established by culturing Mycobacterium chelonei from a corneal biopsy specimen.\n Topical amikacin resolved active inflammation, but dense corneal scarring and a cataract remained.\n Visual rehabilitation was achieved through a combined penetrating keratoplasty, extracapsular cataract extraction, and intraocular lens implantation.\n This case illustrates that there should be a high index of suspicion of atypical mycobacteria when faced with any unusual keratitis, particularly following penetrating injuries and corneal grafts.",
