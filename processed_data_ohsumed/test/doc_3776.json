  "text": "Hyperbaric oxygen as adjunctive therapy for osteomyelitis.\n Mechanistically, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) appears useful for the treatment of osteomyelitis.\n HBO increases the oxygen tension in infected tissue, including bone.\n An adequate oxygen tension is necessary for oxygen-dependent killing of organisms by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes and for fibroblast activity leading to angiogenesis and wound healing.\n HBO has a direct bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic effect on anaerobic organisms.\n In addition, HBO augments the killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the aminoglycoside--tobramycin.\n At the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, adjunctive HBO is used for the Cierny Mader stage 3B and 4B osteomyelitis.",
