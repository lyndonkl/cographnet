  "text": "Simultaneous superior oblique sheathectomy and inferior oblique tuck in congenital Brown's syndrome.\n Since Harold Brown, in 1950, described the superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome, numerous surgical techniques have been explored to treat this condition.\n Tenectomy of the homolateral superior oblique, alone or in combination with a weakening procedure on the homolateral inferior oblique, has been the technique most advocated.\n However, good functional results are rarely achieved in a single procedure, and delayed complications are frequent.\n Taking advantage of the improved dissection and reduced trauma afforded by the use of a surgical microscope, one of the techniques first recommended and later abandoned by Brown was reappraised.\n The technique consists of dissection of the sheath and attachments of the superior oblique, while preserving its tendon, combined with a 10mm tuck of the homolateral inferior oblique.\n Both a typical and a severe atypical congenital case, according to the classification of Brown, were treated in this fashion.\n Full correction was achieved in both.",
