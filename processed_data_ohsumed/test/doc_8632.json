  "text": "Proliferation characteristics of human colorectal carcinomas measured in vivo.\n The cell proliferation kinetics of 100 human colonic and rectal adenocarcinomas have been studied in vivo by bromodeoxyuridine infusion and multiparameter flow cytometry.\n A total of 97 patients, three with synchronous tumours, consented to receive a single bolus dose of 250 mg between 2.4 and 16 h before curative or palliative surgery.\n By this method, the ploidy pattern, the total and aneuploid labelling indices (LI), the S phase duration (Ts) and the potential doubling time (Tpot) can be estimated.\n Of the tumours 48 were diploid and 52 were aneuploid.\n The mean and median total LI of 100 tumours were 9.0 per cent (range 0.7-22.2 per cent).\n The mean aneuploid LI was 12.1 per cent (median 12.0 per cent, range 2.0-25.5 per cent), and was significantly higher than the total LI (P = 0.01).\n The labelling index alone is not a sufficient indicator of proliferation, because the Ts also varies within and between tumours.\n The intertumour range of the Ts varied from 4.0 to 28.6 h.\n The mean was 14.1 h and the median was 13.1 h.\n The mean Tpot was 5.9 days (median 3.9 days) with a range of 1.7-21.4 days.\n No correlation was found between any kinetic parameters and the Dukes' classification or histological classification.\n The correlation between proliferation and prognosis will be established in due course.",
