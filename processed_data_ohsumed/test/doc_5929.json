  "text": "Ketamine as analgesic for total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol.\n A prospective study of 18 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery was performed to study the use of ketamine as an analgesic during total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol.\n A comparison was made with the combination propofol/fentanyl.\n The propofol/ketamine combination resulted in haemodynamically stable anaesthesia without the need for additional analgesics.\n Postoperative behaviour was normal in all patients and none of the patients reported dreaming during or after the operation.\n Propofol seems to be effective in eliminating side effects of a subanaesthetic dose of ketamine in humans.\n We recommend the propofol/ketamine combination for total intravenous anaesthesia for surgery when stable haemodynamics are required.",
