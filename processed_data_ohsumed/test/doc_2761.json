  "text": "Evaluation of drug therapy for treatment of hypertensive urgencies in the emergency department.\n Oral nifedipine (N) and clonidine (C) are often used in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies; however, until recently, there were no comparative studies using the same patient population.\n The authors reviewed the records of hypertensive patients treated in the emergency department between October 1, 1987 and September 30, 1988.\n Selected patients had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than 115 mm Hg without evidence of acute end organ damage.\n Patients were stratified into three treatment groups: N, C, and group 3 (G3).\n G3 received a variety of drug therapies but not exclusively N or C.\n Systolic blood pressure (SBP), DBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), percent decrease in MAP (%MAP), time to lower blood pressure, admissions, and discharges were evaluated.\n Efficacy and safety were defined as reaching a DBP less than 110 mm Hg but %MAP of no greater than either 25% or 40%, respectively.\n Thirty-five N, 32 C, and 27 G3 patients were identified with no statistical difference between groups in race, gender, pretreatment SBP, DBP, or MAP.\n N, C, and G3 significantly reduced SBP, DBP, and MAP (P less than .01).\n Comparing N, C, and G3, no differences were observed in %MAP, admissions, discharges, efficacy, or safety.\n Time required to decrease blood pressure differed between all three groups (44 +/- 32 N v 77 +/- 57 C v 152 +/- 94 min G3) (p less than .05).\n These results indicate that N, C, and a variety of drug therapies are equally effective and safe in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies.",
