  "text": "Studies on the pathogenesis of hypertension in Cushing's disease and acromegaly.\n The pathogenesis of the hypertension associated with Cushing's syndrome and with acromegaly is poorly understood.\n We have investigated the possible roles of sodium retention, activation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased sympathetic nervous system activity in untreated patients.\n In 11 patients with Cushing's disease, seven of whom were hypertensive, total exchangeable sodium was normal despite increased levels of the mineralocorticoid hormones, 11-deoxy-corticosterone and corticosterone.\n The renin-angiotensin system was also normal.\n Cardiac sensitivity to the beta-receptor agonist isoprenaline was increased, but this was not due to an increase in beta-adrenoceptor density.\n Hypertension in Cushing's disease is neither sodium-dependent nor angiotensin II-mediated, but increased cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines, by increasing cardiac output, may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension.\n In nine patients with acromegaly (three of whom were hypertensive) total exchangeable sodium was elevated.\n Although no correlation between blood pressure and exchangeable sodium was found, hypertension in acromegaly is probably sodium dependent.\n No evidence was found for a pathogenetic role for either the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone or the sympathetic nervous system.",
