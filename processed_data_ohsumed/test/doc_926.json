  "text": "Intestinal obstruction by distension of a Foley jejunostomy catheter.\n Jejunostomies can be effective in permitting postoperative nutritional support, particularly in the patient with complicated gastrointestinal disease.\n In the case presented, however, distension of the Foley balloon catheter, used as the jejunostomy tube, led to intestinal obstruction which was not initially detected.\n Following radiographic identification of the problem, removal of the air from the Foley balloon allowed the patient to complete his convalescence from surgery.\n The possibility of obstruction from the Foley jejunostomy catheter should be recognized as a potential problem in the postoperative period.",
