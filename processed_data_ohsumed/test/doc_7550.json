  "text": "Ileocolic neobladder post-cystectomy: continence and potency.\n Incontinence and impotence are 2 of the primary complications associated with total bladder reconstruction after cystectomy for carcinoma.\n These and other features are addressed in 25 patients who underwent total neobladder reconstruction following cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma.\n Of these patients 20 had a urethral anastomosis.\n No patient had to wear a pad or device.\n Enuresis was rare.\n When the radical cystoprostatectomy population was contrasted with a radical prostatectomy patient population, continence was achieved more rapidly in the neobladder group.\n Potency was maintained in 15 of 21 (71%) evaluable patients.\n This ileocolic neobladder produces a large volume and low pressure, and provides excellent day and night continence.\n With preservation of the neurovascular bundle potency can be maintained in the majority of patients.",
