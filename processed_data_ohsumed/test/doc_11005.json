  "text": "Scaphoid malunion.\n We reviewed 10 patients with symptomatic malunion of a carpal scaphoid fracture.\n All had displacement with dorsiflexed intercalated segment instability, and suffered from pain, restricted range of movement at the wrist and decreased grip strength.\n The restriction of flexion-extension and the decreased grip strength correlated with the severity of the DISI deformity.\n Seven patients had a corrective osteotomy, using an anterior wedge-shape bone graft with internal fixation by Herbert screw, and all had satisfactory results.\n We believe that symptoms associated with scaphoid malunion are related to consequent carpal deformity.",
