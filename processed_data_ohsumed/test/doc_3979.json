  "text": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy following intravenous antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis.\n One hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) versus placebo following successful intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for postpartum endometritis.\n No subjects were readmitted to the hospital for recurrent endometritis and there were no wound infections or recurrent fevers.\n Minor side effects were seen in 10% of those taking amoxicillin and 14% of those taking placebo.\n Compliance was fair; only 52% of those taking amoxicillin and 65% of those taking placebo completed therapy.\n The lack of infectious complications in this high-risk population suggests that oral antibiotic therapy is unnecessary after successful IV antibiotic therapy for endometritis.",
