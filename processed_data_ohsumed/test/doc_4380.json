  "text": "Endoscopic management of postoperative biliary leaks: review of 77 cases and report of two cases with biloma formation.\n Biliary leaks are uncommon complications of abdominal surgery.\n Left untreated, they may result in significant morbidity and mortality.\n The traditional treatment has been surgical, but several authors have reported successful endoscopic management.\n We review 77 cases of endoscopically managed postoperative biliary leaks reported in the literature over the past 15 yr.\n Endoscopic treatment was technically successful in 95% of cases, and resulted in biliary leak healing in 82%.\n Cystic stump leaks had a better prognosis for healing compared with common bile duct or hepatic duct leaks.\n We also present two additional cases of postoperative biliary leaks with biloma formation successfully treated with endoscopic stent placement.\n Our experience lends additional support to endoscopic management as the preferred approach to postoperative biliary leaks.",
