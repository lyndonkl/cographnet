  "text": "Effect of obesity on safe duration of apnea in anesthetized humans.\n Obese patients have a decreased functional residual capacity and, hence, a reduced oxygen supply during periods of apnea.\n To determine whether obese patients are at greater risk of developing hypoxemia during induction of anesthesia than patients of normal weight, 24 patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were studied.\n Group 1 (normal) were within 20% of their ideal body weight.\n Group 2 (obese) were more than 20% but less than 45.5 kg over ideal body weight.\n Group 3 (morbidly obese) were more than 45.5 kg over ideal body weight.\n Patients were preoxygenated for 5 min or until expired nitrogen was less than 5%.\n After induction of anesthesia and muscle relaxation the patients were allowed to remain apneic until arterial saturation as measured by pulse oximetry reached 90%.\n The time taken for oxygen saturation to decrease to 90% was 364 +/- 24 s in group 1, 247 +/- 21 s in group 2, and 163 +/- 15 s in group 3; these times are significantly different at P less than 0.05 between groups.\n Regression analysis of the data demonstrated a significant negative linear correlation (r = -0.83) between time to desaturation and increasing obesity.\n These results show that obese patients are at an increased risk of developing hypoxemia when apneic.",
