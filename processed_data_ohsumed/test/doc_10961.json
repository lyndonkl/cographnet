  "text": "Varus of the talus in the ankle mortise secondary to calcaneus fracture. A case report.\n Varus displacement of the talus in the ankle mortise secondary to a calcaneus fracture was observed in a 33-year-old man.\n Similar to the calcaneus fracture-dislocation, the mechanism involved inferior and medial displacement of the talus into the body of the calcaneus.\n The patient's ankle deformity was not corrected by a lateral ankle ligament reconstruction.\n Correction required a distraction subtalar bone block fusion.\n Successful reconstruction of the hindfoot after calcaneus fractures requires a careful analysis of the pathologic lesion.\n In this unusual case, correction required restoration of lost hindfoot bone structure.",
