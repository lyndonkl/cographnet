  "text": "Bleeding gastroesophageal varices: gastric vein embolization after partial portal decompression.\n Shunts that decompress the portal vein are effective in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices.\n Use of large-caliber portacaval shunts, however, results in the complete decompression of the portal system and the risk of subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy.\n Use of small-caliber portacaval shunts results in mild portal hypertension and less frequent hepatic encephalopathy but may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding.\n Thirty-three patients underwent angiography after partial decompression portacaval shunting (median trans-shunt pressures, 8 mm Hg).\n Embolization of residual varices, noted in 13 patients, was performed.\n Results included one complication with no sequelae and no bleeding a mean of 13 months after the procedure was performed.\n Trans-shunt embolization of esophageal varices effectively prevents bleeding varices after partial portal decompression.",
