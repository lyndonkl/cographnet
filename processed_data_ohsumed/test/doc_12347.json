  "text": "Biotin deficiency per se is teratogenic in mice.\n We examined whether maternal biotin deficiency would potentiate the latent teratogenicity of relatively low doses of vitamin A in mice.\n The incidence and the type of gross congenital malformations (cleft palate, micrognathia, and micromelia) induced by biotin deficiency were similar among the groups given three different concentrations of vitamin A (4000, 12,000 and 60,000 IU) in the diet.\n Also, the type of these malformations was different from those (exencephaly, cleft palate and macroglossia) induced by a known teratogenic dose of vitamin A (1,200,000 IU).\n We conclude that in mice concentrations of vitamin A in the range of 4-10 times the level recommended by the National Research Council and biotin deficiency do not interfere with one another; also, biotin deficiency per se is teratogenic in mice.",
