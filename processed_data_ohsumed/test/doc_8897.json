  "text": "Orofacial metastasis of pulmonary giant cell carcinoma.\n A patient was admitted to the hospital with multiple skin nodules of recent origin and signs and symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary infection.\n Because one of the skin masses was located overlying the left mandibular body region, the patient was referred to the hospital dentistry clinic for evaluation.\n Historical, clinical, and radiographic assessments were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy, and an intraoral excisional biopsy was performed.\n The biopsy results were indicative of giant cell carcinoma, which was confirmed by biopsy results from a similar skin lesion on the shoulder and by malignant cells recovered in the sputum and pleural fluids.\n Although this carcinoma has been shown to rarely metastasize to the skin and lymphatics of the neck, this is the first case report of metastasis to facial lymphatics.",
