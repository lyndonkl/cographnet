  "text": "Fracture-separation of the distal humeral epiphysis.\n We have reviewed 12 cases of fracture-separation of the distal humeral epiphysis, three of which were initially misdiagnosed as fractures of the lateral condyle and one as an elbow dislocation.\n Cubitus varus deformity is as common after this fracture-separation as it is following supracondylar fracture, and is most common in children under two years of age.\n Closed reduction and simple immobilisation is adequate for the older child, but we recommend for those under two years of age that closed reduction should be followed by percutaneous pinning, so that the carrying angle can be assessed immediately after reduction.\n If the elbow is then in varus the wires should be removed, reduction repeated and treatment by straight lateral traction used to maintain a valgus carrying angle.",
