  "text": "Acute complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for total occlusion.\n The incidence of major complications after percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a totally occluded artery was assessed retrospectively.\n A total of 1649 PTCA procedures were analyzed.\n After exclusion of procedures for acute myocardial infarction or total occlusion that resulted from restenosis, 90 patients were selected.\n Forty-four patients (49%) had stable angina and 46 (51%) had unstable angina.\n The estimated duration of occlusion was 87 +/- 78 days in patients with stable angina, as compared with 10 +/- 8 days in patients with unstable angina (p less than 0.001).\n Abrupt vessel closure during PTCA occurred only in patients with unstable angina (0% versus 17%, p less than 0.05).\n The major complication rate was 2.5% in the stable angina group, and 20% in unstable angina group (p less than 0.01).\n This rate was also significantly higher than the complication rate of 8% observed in 442 procedures that were performed during the same period in patients with the unstable angina and nonocclusive stenosis (p less than 0.01).\n Patients with unstable angina who undergo PTCA of a totally occluded artery represent a subset of high risk for major complications.",
