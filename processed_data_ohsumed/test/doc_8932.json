  "text": "The management of malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents.\n A series of 205 pediatric patients affected by osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone were treated from 1978 to 1988.\n Ninety-eight percent of the patients received chemotherapy and 63% had a surgical resection.\n Sixty-five percent of all patients were alive at 30 months and were considered disease free.\n The functional results after surgery were evaluated according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score.\n In all diaphyseal resections and resections of the upper extremity and pelvis, the results were excellent or good in 60% of the cases.\n In resections of the proximal femur, distal femur, or proximal tibia and reconstruction with nonexpansible prostheses, the results were excellent or good in 75%.\n On the other hand, when arthrodeses of the lower extremity were used, only 14% of cases had a good result.\n This correlates with the resulting lack of articulation and serious limb shortening seen with progression of skeletal growth.",
