  "text": "The relationship between symptomatic and biochemical hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetic patients.\n The relationship between symptomatic (subjective feelings) and biochemical (blood glucose concentration less than 3 mmol l-1) hypoglycaemia was studied in 66 randomly selected insulin-dependent diabetic out-patients under normal conditions of daily life with conventional insulin injection regimens.\n The patients (a) collected 7-point diurnal blood glucose profiles at home on three consecutive days and then once weekly for 3 weeks, (b) indicated whether they felt hypoglycaemic at sampling times, and (c) collected extra samples if they felt hypoglycaemic at any time during the study period.\n The weekly frequencies of symptomatic and biochemical hypoglycaemia were 0.99 and 1.75 per patient, respectively.\n Biochemical hypoglycaemia was present in 29% of the symptomatic episodes, and symptomatic hypoglycaemia accompanied 16% of the biochemical episodes.\n Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was experienced at a median blood glucose concentration of 3.4 mmol l-1 (range 1.4-14.9 mmol l-1).\n Fifty per cent of both symptomatic and biochemical episodes occurred before lunch, while the remainder were evenly distributed throughout the day.\n The occurrence of biochemical hypoglycaemia, but not of symptomatic hypoglycaemia, was inversely correlated with HbA1c and median blood glucose concentration.\n Thus symptomatic hypoglycaemia is an unreliable indicator of biochemical hypoglycaemia and of the degree of glycaemic control.\n Blood glucose measurements are a prerequisite for the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.",
