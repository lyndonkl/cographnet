  "text": "Hair transplantation (a new method for recipient site suturing): the upper dermal running stitch.\n Recipient hair transplant plugs may heal into place with palpable, and unfortunately, visible borders.\n This appearance, called \"cobblestoning,\" is reminiscent of the bumps in a cobblestone street.\n The author presents a new, rapid method of suturing transplanted plugs that greatly reduces cobblestoning, virtually eliminates traumatic plug loss, and facilitates row-by-row hair transplantation.\n Additionally, postoperative bandaging is not necessary, shower cleansing may commence within hours, and postoperative activity may be unlimited.",
