  "text": "Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients.\n OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic.\n DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively).\n SETTING: Acute care hospital.\n PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr.\n INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated.\n All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition.\n The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%).\n The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids.\n At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy.\n All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition.\n The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat.\n The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day.\n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs.\n 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases.\n N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE.\n The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation.\n CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients.\n The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion.",
