  "text": "Fistulas between the aorta and tracheobronchial tree.\n Aortobronchial fistula is a rare condition that is invariably fatal if not diagnosed and surgically treated.\n With appropriate surgical intervention, survival rates greater than 70% can be achieved.\n A review of the literature and an illustrative case report are presented.\n A total of 63 fistulas in 62 patients have been described.\n The case we present is unusual in the use of serratus anterior muscle for repair of the fistula.\n Eighty-seven percent of the cases documented in the literature were associated with an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta.\n Eighty-six percent of the fistulas were between the descending aorta and left bronchopulmonary tree.\n More than 95% of patients experienced at least a single episode of hemoptysis, and massive hemoptysis occurred in more than half of the reported cases.\n A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 54% of cases.\n Plain chest radiographs definitively demonstrated an aneurysm in only 16%.\n The computed tomographic scan was the most rewarding test, identifying an aneurysm in 11 of 12 patients and the fistula in 50% of them.\n Surgical repair resulted in a 76% survival rate.",
