  "text": "Chronic effects of focused electrohydraulic shock waves on renal function and hypertension.\n The chronic effects of focused electrohydraulic shock waves were studied in a minipig model.\n Fifteen animals underwent a unilateral nephrectomy and compensatory renal hypertrophy was allowed to take place over a minimum of six months.\n Baseline studies were then carried out consisting of 1) serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and plasma renin levels 2) intra-arterial blood pressure measurement and 3) 3H-inulin clearance.\n Ten of the animals then underwent 8 shockwave treatments (2500 shocks per treatment), alternately to the upper and lower pole of the kidney, at two weeks intervals.\n A total of 20,000 shock waves were administered to each minipig over the four month period.\n The five control pigs underwent sham procedures.\n The renal function and blood pressure evaluations were then repeated.\n No significant decrease in renal function was noted in the experimental animals when compared to the controls.\n In addition, renin mediated hypertension was not observed despite the excessive number of total shock waves delivered to the kidney.",
