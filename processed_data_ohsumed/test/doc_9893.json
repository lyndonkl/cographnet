  "text": "Anton's syndrome in a patient with posttraumatic optic neuropathy and bifrontal contusions.\n We describe a patient who manifested Anton's syndrome after sustaining head trauma that resulted in optic nerve damage and bifrontal contusions.\n Denial of monocular blindness, generalized anosognosia, and confabulation were prominent neurobehavioral features.\n Anton's syndrome is most commonly encountered in patients with bilateral occipital cortex lesions.\n Patients previously described who demonstrated Anton's syndrome secondary to a peripheral lesion have had an associated delirium or profound dementia.\n Our case demonstrates that Anton's syndrome may occur in association with blindness from a peripheral lesion, even in the absence of a delirium or significant dementia.\n We suggest that the bifrontal dysfunction may have been a critical factor in the production of Anton's syndrome.\n Implications for the role of frontal lobe dysfunction in the genesis of anosognosia and confabulation are discussed.",
