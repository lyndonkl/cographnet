  "text": "Epidemiology of ocular complications of childhood head trauma \n Head trauma is a frequent cause of childhood morbidity and mortality.\n We have studied 293 children aged zero to 18 years who suffered from head trauma, in order to assess the importance and frequency of ocular complications of head trauma.\n Very significant statistical differences show that children aged zero to 12 years are at risk for ocular complications more frequently than older children.\n The prompt diagnosis of ocular symptoms and signs and their differentiation can be of value in the early and correct diagnosis of head trauma, thus insuring effective treatment.\n These data emphasize the importance and prevention of head trauma in children.\n A pediatric victim of head trauma can surely benefit from the strict cooperation among emergency specialists, pediatricians, ophthalmologists, and neurologists.",
