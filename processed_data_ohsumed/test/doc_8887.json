  "text": "Clinical importance of myeloid-antigen expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood.\n BACKGROUND.\n Leukemic cells in 15 to 25 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) express myeloid antigens as well as lymphoid antigens (the latter reflecting B-cell or T-cell lineage).\n The relations of myeloid-antigen expression to other features of ALL and to prognosis have been controversial.\n METHODS.\n We analyzed clinical and laboratory features present at diagnosis in 236 consecutive cases of ALL in children.\n Immunophenotyping, including single- and dual-fluorescence analyses, was used to classify leukemic cells as B or T lymphoblasts and also to identify myeloid-antigen expression--the simultaneous expression of lymphoid-associated antigens and at least one of three myeloid-associated antigens (CD33, CD13, and CD14) on cells classified as L1 or L2 according to the French-American-British system.\n RESULTS.\n Forty-five of 185 patients with B-lineage ALL had myeloid-antigen expression, as did 8 of 41 patients with T-lineage ALL.\n In 10 patients, the lineage could not be determined.\n Myeloid-antigen expression was associated with L2 morphology (P less than 0.05), but it did not correlate with other prognostic features recognized previously.\n Multivariate analysis showed that myeloid-antigen expression was an important predictor of relapse in childhood ALL and the most significant prognostic factor statistically (P less than 0.0001).\n A white-cell count greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9) per liter at diagnosis was also an important and highly significant prognostic feature (P less than 0.001).\n After 40 months, the estimated disease-free survival for patients with ALL was 84 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a low white-cell count, 57 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a high white-cell count, 47 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a low white-cell count, and 26 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a high white-cell count (P less than 0.00001).\n CONCLUSIONS.\n Myeloid-antigen expression is an important independent predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL.",
