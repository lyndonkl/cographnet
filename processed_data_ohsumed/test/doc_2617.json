  "text": "Spinal cord arteriovenous malformation with an associated lymphatic anomaly. Case report.\n Spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (AVM's), like other vascular anomalies of the central nervous system, can be associated with similar vascular lesions of the skin and viscera.\n A 7-year-old girl, who presented with rapidly progressing paraplegia, was found to have a spinal cord AVM, cutaneous angioma, and a chylous malformation of the lymphatic system.\n She had previously undergone treatment for a posterior thoracic cutaneous angioma.\n At surgery, upon incision of the paravertebral muscle fascia, viscous pale fluid was encountered emanating from a foramen in the thoracic lamina.\n The spinal AVM was resected in spite of concern that the abnormality represented spinal osteomyelitis.\n Postoperatively, there was full return of function in the lower extremities, along with recurrent episodes of chylothorax, which slowly came under control with dietary manipulation.\n A review of the anatomy of the thoracic duct and nontraumatic causes of chylothorax is presented, and the association of cutaneous and central angiomas is discussed.\n Finally, the treatment of chylothorax is delineated.",
