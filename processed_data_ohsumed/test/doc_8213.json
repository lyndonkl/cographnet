  "text": "Historical review of pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery.\n From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity.\n For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%.\n Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients.\n Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected.\n Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation.",
