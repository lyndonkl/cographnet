  "text": "Oral contraception in disease states.\n Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke.\n Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding.\n Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery.\n Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation.\n Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation.",
