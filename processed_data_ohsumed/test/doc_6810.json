  "text": "Hemoglobin Columbia Missouri or alpha 2[88 (F9) Ala----Val]beta 2: a new high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobin that causes erythrocytosis.\n A previously undescribed hemoglobin variant, hemoglobin Columbia Missouri, alpha 88 (F9) Ala----Val, was detected in a 22-year-old white man who was undergoing assessment for erythrocytosis.\n This new hemoglobin variant does not separate from hemoglobin A by electrophoresis in conventional media, by isoelectric focusing, or by electrophoresis of purified globin chains in 8 M urea.\n It exhibits a high oxygen affinity, with a P50 (oxygen tension at 50% saturation) of 19.3 torr for the patient's whole blood.\n The substitution of hemoglobin Columbia Missouri is an internal residue near the end of the F helix of the alpha chain.\n Hemoglobin Okazaki has an arginyl residue substitution for a cysteinyl residue at F9 (beta 93) in the beta chain.\n In comparison with hemoglobin Okazaki, the substitution in hemoglobin Columbia Missouri has a more pronounced effect on oxygen affinity.\n Consequently, hemoglobin Columbia Missouri is associated with erythrocytosis, whereas hemoglobin Okazaki is not.",
