  "text": "Active vs passive rhythms as an explanation of bigeminal rhythm with similar P waves.\n We describe the criteria for differential diagnosis between 3:2 sinoatrial block from atrial bigeminy due to an ectopic focus in the sinus or parasinus zone.\n In the 3:2 sinoatrial block the RR interval of the basic rhythm is similar to the short R-R interval of the paired rhythm.\n In atrial bigeminy, the R-R interval of the basic rhythm is similar to the long R-R interval of the paired rhythm.",
