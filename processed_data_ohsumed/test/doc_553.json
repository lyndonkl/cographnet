  "text": "Radiological abnormalities among sheet-metal workers in the construction industry in the United States and Canada: relationship to asbestos exposure.\n We investigated the possible adverse health effects to sheet-metal workers who had past exposure to asbestos.\n A cross-sectional medical examination of 1,330 workers was conducted during 1986 and 1987 in seven cities in the United States and Canada.\n A total of 1,016 workers had been employed for at least 35 y in the industry, and the mean duration from onset of asbestos exposure was 39.5 y (SD = 7.41 y).\n Chest x-ray abnormalities were found in more than half of the group.\n Pleural fibrosis, the most frequently found abnormality, was present in 47.0% of the cases and was the only abnormality found in 27.8% of cases; parenchymal interstitial fibrosis, found in 33.1% of cases, was the only abnormality found in 16.2% of cases.\n Radiologic abnormalities increased as duration of exposure increased.\n A positive smoking history was associated with a higher prevalence of radiologically detectable parenchymal abnormalities, a finding confirmed by us and others.\n Dyspnea on exertion was graded by a Medical Research Council questionnaire, the examinee's self-assessment, and a more detailed 12-point scale questionnaire.\n Few persons had marked shortness of breath, and approximately one-third had slight dyspnea.\n Individuals who had radiologic abnormalities experienced more shortness of breath than did those who had no radiologic abnormalities.\n Cigarette smoking also resulted in a higher prevalence of dyspnea.\n The results indicate that during the past, construction sheet-metal workers have been significantly exposed to asbestos on the job.\n Every effort should be made to minimize the anticipated serious health consequences, and further asbestos exposure for those who continue in this trade should be avoided.",
