  "text": "Colonic volvulus as a complication of celiac sprue.\n Colonic volvulus has been a rarely reported complication of celiac sprue.\n We describe two patients with long-standing celiac sprue, one in whom a recurrent sigmoid volvulus developed, and in the other, a cecal volvulus.\n Following surgery, both are now asymptomatic on a gluten-free diet.\n The association between celiac sprue and colonic volvulus was first reported in 1953.\n There have been only a few isolated cases documented, surprisingly so because the two major predisposing conditions for colonic volvulus are often seen in patients with celiac sprue.\n Colonic bacterial fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrate (in celiac sprue) leads to excess gas production.\n Flaccid bowel loops with sigmoid redundancy, a long mesentery, or cecal hypermobility are not uncommon.\n A motility disorder in celiac sprue has also been proposed.\n Thus these factors together would suggest that the likelihood of development of colonic volvulus in celiac sprue would be relatively great.\n The possibility of underlying celiac sprue should be considered in patients with colonic volvulus who have a background history of recurrent abdominal distention or malabsorptive symptoms.",
