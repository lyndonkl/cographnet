  "text": "Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report.\n Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus.\n Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts.\n Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated.\n A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic.",
