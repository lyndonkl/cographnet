  "text": "The prolonged burner syndrome.\n Over the course of a single football season, six players evaluated by the medical staff had burners that displayed a prolonged neurologic recovery.\n These players were examined and subsequently evaluated with isokinetic testing and electrodiagnostic studies to elucidate better the short-term natural history of the prolonged burner syndrome.\n Evidence of muscular weakness at 72 hours postinjury best correlated with positive electrodiagnostic findings.\n No correlation was found between the initial physical examination findings and the results of electrodiagnostic testing.\n Isokinetic strength evaluation demonstrated many relative strength differences that were difficult to discern with manual muscle testing.\n The return of a player to athletic competition following this injury should largely be based on the clinical examination.",
