  "text": "Bilateral femoral retroversion associated with acetabular dysplasia. A case report.\n Retroversion of the proximal femur is associated with a number of acquired conditions but is unusual in a congenital form.\n It is even more unusual to be associated with acetabular dysplasia.\n A 38-year-old woman with bilateral hip pain had roentgenographic evidence of acetabular dysplasia with valgus neck-shaft angles.\n Physical findings were consistent with femoral retroversion, and computed tomography demonstrated 28 degrees of retroversion on both sides.\n Symptomatic relief was obtained with bilateral varus internal rotation osteotomies of the proximal femur.\n To date, a case of retroverted femora associated with acetabular dysplasia seems not to have been reported in the literature.",
