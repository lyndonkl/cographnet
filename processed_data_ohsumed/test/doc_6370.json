  "text": "Photosensitized destruction of human bladder carcinoma cells treated with chlorin e6-conjugated microspheres.\n A photosensitizer conjugate, chlorin e6 (Ce6) covalently bound to 1-micron-diameter polystyrene microspheres, has been investigated in the photodynamic destruction of MGH-U1 human bladder carcinoma cells in vitro.\n The microspheres were taken up avidly by the carcinoma cells; confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy showed them to be localized in the cytoplasm, apparently within lysosomes, visualized by labeling with acridine orange.\n In contrast, fluorescence of unconjugated Ce6 was present within most cellular membranes.\n Use of Ce6-microsphere conjugates led to a 20-fold-higher mean intracellular concentration, compared with unconjugated Ce6.\n Cells incubated in the presence of Ce6-microsphere conjugates (0.43 microM equivalent) and subsequently irradiated at 659 nm with a dye laser pumped by an argon-ion laser showed dose-dependent phototoxicity, leading to total inhibition of colony formation at a radiant exposure of 5J/cm2; in contrast, cells incubated with either unconjugated Ce6 (0.43 microM) or unconjugated microspheres before laser irradiation were unaffected.\n Cells pretreated with Ce6-microsphere conjugates and irradiated in the presence of 90% 2H2O showed significantly increased phototoxicity, an effect consistent with an important role for excited-state singlet oxygen in the mechanism of injury.\n In solution, however, photosensitized generation of singlet oxygen with Ce6-microsphere conjugates was 9 times less efficient than with unconjugated Ce6.\n The markedly greater phototoxicity of Ce6-microsphere conjugates compared to unconjugated Ce6 was therefore a consequence of the high intracellular Ce6 concentration attained by phagocytosis of the conjugates and their particular sites of intracellular localization.\n Thus, these conjugates are an efficient system for the delivery of photosensitizing drugs to carcinoma cells.",
