  "text": "Endoscopic and computed tomographic findings in ostiomeatal sinus disease.\n Previously, there has been no organized format for the documentation of the findings of the nasal endoscopy and the coronal computed tomographic sinus scan.\n The findings from 100 nasal endoscopies and computed tomographic scans were reviewed and summarized.\n The summarized findings were incorporated into two forms--\"the Nasal Endoscopy Exam Form\" and the \"Computed Tomographic Scan Findings [form]\"--utilizing computerized graphics techniques.\n The forms are presented along with their illustration of pathologic ostiomeatal findings.\n These forms represent a method of documentation of nasal endoscopic and coronal computed tomographic scan findings.\n They may be used in the demonstration of disease, treatment, planning, resident training, communication of information, and assisting in a future classification of degrees of severity of sinus disease.",
