  "text": "Recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy associated with a fatty-acid oxidation defect in the offspring.\n A case of a 29-year-old woman who has had two episodes both clinically and biochemically consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy is described.\n These episodes occurred in two successive pregnancies, and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in the second pregnancy.\n Both pregnancies were managed by prompt fetal delivery; on both occasions this led to a complete biochemical resolution of the liver function abnormalities.\n Two healthy babies were delivered by ceasarian sections.\n This case is of particular importance because a rapidly progressive and devastating illness developed in both infants, leading to death at 6 1/2 and 6 months, respectively.\n The illness in both babies was characterized by wide-spread fatty infiltration of several vital organs and a failure of any treatment to influence the outcome of that illness.\n Studies suggested that the illness in the children was caused by a still ill-defined disorder of fatty acid oxidation.\n The biochemical disorder evidenced in this family is discussed, in an attempt to shed light on the etiology of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",
