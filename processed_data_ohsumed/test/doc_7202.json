  "text": "Factors affecting fusion rate in adult spondylolisthesis.\n The authors examined factors affecting fusion rate in the surgical treatment of 89 consecutive adult patients with spondylolisthesis.\n Two factors significantly improved fusion rate: combined anterior and posterior fusion and rigid postoperative immobilization in the cast.\n In 65 patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis, the fusion rate was raised from 70% when posterior fusion alone was used to 88% when combined anterior and posterior fusion was used.\n In 20 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, frequent use of combined anterior and posterior fusion contributed to a high overall fusion rate of 95%.\n Among patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis, postoperative cast immobilization resulted in a higher fusion rate of 90% compared with a fusion rate of 63% obtained after brace immobilization.",
