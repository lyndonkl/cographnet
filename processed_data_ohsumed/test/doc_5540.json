  "text": "Successful control of bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia (watermelon stomach) by laser photocoagulation.\n We report a case of gastric antral vascular ectasia in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis in whom chronic blood loss was a major problem.\n She required repeated blood transfusions that were complicated by reactions and still had persistent anaemia.\n She was treated with laser phototherapy in the form of quadrantic photocoagulation with a neodynium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser.\n This greatly improved the endoscopic appearance of the gastric lesions and effectively controlled blood loss.\n She required no further transfusions.\n Bleeding recurred after 11 months which was controlled by further laser photocoagulation.",
