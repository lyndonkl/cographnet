  "text": "Endothelial cell adhesiveness for human T lymphocytes is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1.\n Recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was found to inhibit the adhesive phenotype of human umbilical vein endothelial cells for human PBL, purified T lymphocytes, and PHA-activated lymphoblasts.\n TGF-beta inhibited lymphocyte attachment to resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells and also to endothelial monolayers stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta.\n Our investigations also show that the ability of endothelial cells to respond to TGF-beta by altering their adhesiveness is lost with prolonged culture of the cells.\n However, this loss is selective as TGF-beta inhibits cell proliferation in both early and late passage endothelial cells.\n These results suggest that in vivo TGF-beta may inhibit the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells and also may limit the immunologic response occurring at the endothelial cell barrier.",
