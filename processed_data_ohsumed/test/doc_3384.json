  "text": "Hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography of the uterus and fallopian tubes: results of a clinical trial of a new contrast medium in 120 patients.\n The feasibility, diagnostic efficacy, and patient tolerance of a new diagnostic modality, hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy), were evaluated in a clinical study of 120 patients with suspected infertility.\n A new echogenic contrast medium for ultrasound was administered transcervically with conventional tools for hysterosalpingography or a balloon catheter.\n The flow of multiple fractions of the contrast medium through each fallopian tube was observed in real time in appropriate imaging planes by means of a transvaginal probe.\n All patent tubes were diagnosed correctly with HyCoSy, results comparing well with findings at hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy.\n With B-mode scanning only, sensitivity was 88% for the right tube and 90% for the left; specificity was 100% for each tube.\n The supplementary use of Doppler techniques (duplex, color Doppler) provided additional information in special cases of suspected tubal occlusion and led to an improvement in diagnostic accuracy.\n The contrast agent was well tolerated.\n HyCoSy demonstrates normal anatomy and tubal patency with high reliability and permits advance selection of patients in whom more invasive diagnostic procedures may be required.",
