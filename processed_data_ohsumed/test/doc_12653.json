  "text": "A comparison of total and partial tenonectomy with trabeculectomy.\n We compared the results of two methods of tenonectomy at the time of trabeculectomy.\n Of 49 eyes, 23 were randomly assigned to a partial tenonectomy and 26 to a total tenonectomy.\n There was no statistically significant difference in the success rate between the two surgical groups using an upper limit of intraocular pressure of either 18 or 21 mm Hg as the criterion for success.\n There was no difference in the need for postoperative medications or further surgical intervention between the two groups.\n Although certain advantages exist with each technique, these findings suggest that equivalent results can be anticipated with either a total or partial tenonectomy.",
