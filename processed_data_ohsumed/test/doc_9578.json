  "text": "Handcuff neuropathies \n Compressive neuropathy due to tight application of handcuffs occurred in 5 patients.\n The superficial radial nerve was affected in 8 hands and the median nerve in two.\n Neurologic deficits persisted as long as 3 years after handcuffing.\n Nerve conduction studies helped to exclude malingering and other diagnoses.\n All patients had been intoxicated when handcuffed or had been arrested with force.\n The handcuff mechanism, which allows accidental overtightening after application, is an unrecognized factor in these neuropathies.",
