  "text": "Combined vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas associated with a vaginal foreign body.\n A case is presented of vesicovaginal-ureterovaginal fistulas associated with a neglected vaginal foreign body.\n The patient complained of a foul-smelling vaginal discharge and was found to have a 4-cm hard vaginal mass on examination.\n Urinary incontinence developed subsequently.\n Examination under anesthesia was performed, and an aerosol deodorant cap was operatively removed from her posterior vagina/perirectal space.\n Subsequent work-up demonstrated the presence of both a vesicovaginal fistula and a right ureterovaginal fistula.\n The patient underwent a combined vaginal repair of the vesicovaginal fistula and abdominal ureteroneocystostomy.\n The frequency, types, etiology, and treatment of genitourinary fistulas are reviewed with particular attention to those associated with a vaginal foreign body.",
