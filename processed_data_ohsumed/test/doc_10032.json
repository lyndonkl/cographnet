  "text": "The acromegalic rosary \n Palpable enlargement of the costochondral junctions on the anterolateral chest wall was detected in 26 of 27 patients with acromegaly.\n In a further study three doctors wearing eyemasks examined a further 13 acromegalic patients and 12 control subjects; costochondral enlargement was detected with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 86%.\n It was not found in normal subjects in the absence of previous chest injury.\n The presence and extent of costochondral enlargement was unrelated to the duration of active or cured acromegaly, the initial or present growth hormone concentrations, or other clinical features of growth hormone excess.\n Costochondral enlargement is a common clinical sign in acromegaly and can serve as a biological marker of previous or current growth hormone excess.",
