  "text": "B-cell differentiation following autologous, conventional, or T-cell depleted bone marrow transplantation: a recapitulation of normal B-cell ontogeny.\n The circulating lymphocytes of 88 consecutive patients following autologous, conventional, or T-cell depleted bone marrow transplantation were serially analyzed for B-cell surface antigen expression and function.\n In the majority of patients, except for those who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease, the number of circulating CD20+ B cell normalized by the fourth posttransplant month.\n The earliest detectable B cells normally expressed HLA-DR, CD19, surface immunoglobulin (slg), CD21, Leu-8, and lacked expression of CD10 (CALLA).\n In addition, the circulating B cells expressed CD1c, CD38, CD5, and CD23 for the first year following transplant, antigens that are normally expressed on a small percentage of circulating B cells in normal adults, but highly expressed on cord blood B cells.\n Similar to cord blood B cells, patient B cells isolated during the first year following transplant, proliferated normally to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC), and produced IgM, but minimal or no IgG when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen and SAC, unlike normal adult B cells that produce both.\n The similar phenotype and function of posttransplant and cord blood B cells, and their similar rate of decline in patients and normal children adds further evidence to support the hypothesis that B-cell differentiation posttransplant is recapitulating normal B-cell ontogeny.",
