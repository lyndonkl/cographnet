  "text": "Surgical procedures in the management of Takayasu's arteritis.\n Takayasu's arteritis is an inflammatory arteriopathy that often progresses to obliteration of multiple large arteries.\n Variable results have been reported after medical and surgical management.\n Twenty female patients with Takayasu's arteritis were treated from 1973 to 1989.\n Eleven (55%) patients had hypertension.\n Upper or lower extremity ischemia was present in 12 (60%) patients and cerebrovascular insufficiency in seven (35%).\n Nine patients initially managed with corticosteroids had no improvement in signs or symptoms of arterial insufficiency.\n Eleven patients had 16 vascular procedures for the following indications: renovascular hypertension (6), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilation ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), abdominal aortic aneurysm (1).\n Procedures included aortorenal bypass (5), carotid-subclavian, axillary, or brachial bypass (4), aorto-carotid bypass (2), aneurysm resection (2), supra-celiac aorto-femoral bypass (1), ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (1), and nephrectomy (1).\n Clinical improvement occurred in all patients.\n There were no operative deaths.\n All are alive at a mean follow-up of 5.75 years (6 months to 16 years).\n Revision of the initial reconstruction has been required for recurrent renovascular hypertension in one patient and extremity ischemia in another.\n The other nine patients remain symptomatically improved.\n Symptomatic Takayasu's arteritis frequently requires arterial reconstruction.\n Symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term graft patency can be expected after arterial reconstruction.",
