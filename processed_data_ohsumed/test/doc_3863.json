  "text": "Coronary artery bypass operation in dialysis patients.\n To analyze the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality among maintenance dialysis patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass operations, we identified 25 such patients at the Mayo Clinic and three recently published large single-center studies that provided sufficient detail for meaningful comparison.\n Two independent observers reviewed the new information with regard to pertinent historical, clinical, and laboratory data.\n The perioperative mortality was 20%.\n Among the perioperative survivors, 1- and 2-year survival rates were 95% and 77%, respectively.\n The 3-year actuarial survival was 70%.\n Uniformly, the symptoms diminished, and the need for antianginal medication was decreased.\n In the three other large published series, the perioperative mortality ranged from 3 to 20%, and coronary artery bypass performed earlier after the onset of the symptoms seemed to result in a lower perioperative mortality.\n We conclude that elective coronary artery bypass in dialysis patients is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and effective relief of symptoms.\n Surgically treated patients may have a survival advantage.\n Thus, we advocate aggressive early investigation and surgical treatment of these patients.",
