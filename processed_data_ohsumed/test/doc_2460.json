  "text": "New horizons in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis.\n The application of recombinant DNA methodology to clinical medicine offers the clinician a new generation of more potent and specific therapies.\n Recombinant methods offer great promise in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis.\n This review focuses on the characterization of 1) molecules that activate plasminogen locally (in the vicinity of a thrombus) rather than systemically, and 2) molecules that offer new approaches to the inhibition of platelet activation and thrombin activity.\n We first describe the methods used to uncover these molecules and their characterization at the molecular level.\n The ways in which this knowledge can lead to the development of agents tailored to clinical needs are then explored.",
