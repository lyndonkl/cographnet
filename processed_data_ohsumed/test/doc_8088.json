  "text": "Variability in DNA measurements in multiple tumor samples of human colonic carcinoma.\n The DNA ploidy and cell-cycle distribution of three separate fresh tissue samples of 60 colorectal adenocarcinomas were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n DNA ploidy was concordant among the three samples in 38 cases (63.3%).\n In the remaining 22 cases (36.6%), the DNA histograms of two of the three multiple samples were similar; however, the ploidy of the third sample was discordant.\n No relationship was observed between Dukes' stage and histologic grade with concordance or discordance among samples.\n Thus, in about one third of the colonic carcinomas, a single sample showing either a diploid or diploid-cycling DNA histogram would not detect aneuploid DNA patterns.\n Comparison of scrapes and fine-needle aspirates of tumors as alternative sampling methods of tumors for DNA ploidy analysis indicated a strong association with the tumor ploidy (84% and 96%, respectively) only when the ploidy of the multiple samples was concordant.\n In about 25% of the cases, tumor scrapes and fine-needle aspirates did not correlate with the \"most abnormal\" ploidy observed in one of the three tissue samples.\n The data suggest that single or even double tissue samples may not show aneuploid DNA patterns in a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers.",
