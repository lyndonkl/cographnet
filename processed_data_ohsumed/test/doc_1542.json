  "text": "Lymphoproliferative responses to Borrelia burgdorferi in Lyme disease.\n OBJECTIVE: To compare lymphocyte proliferative responses to Borrelia burgdorferi in healthy controls and patients with Lyme disease.\n PATIENTS: Twelve patients fulfilling case-definition criteria for Lyme disease.\n Twelve healthy volunteers and two newborns served as controls.\n MEASUREMENTS: Antibodies to B.\n burgdorferi were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 5 days with B.\n burgdorferi, recall antigens, or pokeweed mitogen was measured by radioactive thymidine uptake.\n RESULTS: Lymphocytes from 11 patients with Lyme disease, 8 healthy seronegative controls, and two newborns showed elevated responses when stimulated with B.\n burgdorferi.\n When a patient and a control were studied on the same day, the patient's lymphocyte response to B.\n burgdorferi exceeded the control's in only 5 of 12 cases.\n Lymphocytes from both patients and controls responded to B.\n burgdorferi isolates from three different sources.\n CONCLUSIONS: Heightened lymphocyte responses to B.\n burgdorferi are found in patients with Lyme disease but elevated responses also frequently occur in healthy controls.\n At present, the interpretation of a positive lymphocyte response to B.\n burgdorferi would be difficult in ambiguous clinical situations.",
