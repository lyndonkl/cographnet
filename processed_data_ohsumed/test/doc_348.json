  "text": "Pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir in a patient undergoing hemodialysis.\n The pharmacokinetics and effect of hemodialysis on the clearance of ganciclovir were evaluated in a patient with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis and pneumonitis requiring dialytic support.\n A dose of 300 mg ganciclovir (5 mg/kg) was administered by intravenous infusion over a 60-minute period.\n Blood samples were obtained over the next 10 hours and used to assess plasma ganciclovir concentrations.\n The patient underwent hemodialysis the following day during which paired arterial and venous blood samples were obtained to determine dialyzer clearance of this antiviral agent.\n High-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify ganciclovir plasma concentrations.\n Ganciclovir levels declined in a monoexponential manner following infusion and prior to dialysis.\n The patient's peak ganciclovir concentration was markedly elevated (20 micrograms/mL) compared with previously reported peak concentrations in patients with normal renal function.\n Similarly, the elimination half-life (t1/2) was increased (6.3 hours) in this patient compared with values reported in patients with normal renal function.\n The volume of distribution (0.21 L/kg) and total body clearance prior to hemodialysis (35.5 mL/min) were diminished in this patient.\n Hemodialysis reduced ganciclovir levels by approximately 62% with an extraction coefficient of 0.29 resulting in a dialyzer clearance of 48.3 mL/min.\n This supports supplementation of ganciclovir in patients receiving this antiviral agent when they are undergoing hemodialysis.\n Additionally, close monitoring of ganciclovir concentrations in patients with abnormal renal function is necessary in order to make appropriate dosage adjustments.",
