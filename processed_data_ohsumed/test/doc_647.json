  "text": "Gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether in 120 patients--efficacy and safety.\n Of 612 patients with cholesterol gallbladder stones, 120 were eligible for percutaneous transhepatic litholysis with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).\n Puncture of the gallbladder was successful in 117/120 (97.5%).\n In 113/117 (96.6%) the stones dissolved.\n With solitary stones, treatment lasted for an average of 4 hr, with multiple stones 10 hr.\n Mean hospitalization was 3.6 days.\n In 3/117 (2.6%) patients a bile leakage developed; 33% reported mild complaints.\n After the end of treatment 34% had some residue in the gallbladder; two of these patients developed recurrent stones.\n MTBE is exhaled, is distributed in fatty tissue, and is excreted renally together with its metabolite tert-butanol.\n Methanol was found only in traces.\n Gallbladder histology of six patients showed chronic cholecystitis.\n Since these findings were independent of treatment time and the interval between treatment end and operation, they are most consistent with stone-related changes rather than caused by MTBE.",
