  "text": "Pulmonary neoplastic and lymphoproliferative disease in AIDS: a review.\n Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma are the most common forms of neoplastic disease encountered in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n Pulmonary involvement is fairly common with Kaposi sarcoma, while lymphoma only rarely involves the lungs.\n There has been a significant increase in the number of AIDS patients who develop Kaposi sarcoma, especially male homosexuals.\n There has also been an increase in the incidence of high-grade (aggressive) lymphoma in male homosexuals (and young men in general).\n Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia is a chronic condition that primarily affects adults and is becoming more common in patients with AIDS.\n When present in children less than 13 years old, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia is considered to be an indication of AIDS.\n Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and a condition resembling angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy are also being found in children with AIDS.\n A review of the literature on neoplastic and lymphoproliferative disease in AIDS suggests that a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders in AIDS can be expected in the future.",
