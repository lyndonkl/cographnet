  "text": "Restoration of the anterior neck surface in the burned patient by free groin flap.\n In treating extensive burn contractures of the anterior neck, we obtained good results using free flaps.\n Ninety-nine patients with neck contractures were treated with free flaps.\n The ages of the patients range from 2 to 64 years.\n We used 84 free groin flaps, 10 free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flaps, 2 free deltopectoral flaps, 2 free scapular flaps, and 1 free anterolateral thigh flap.\n In all patients, contractures were sufficiently released and no recurrences followed after a mean follow-up of 8.7 years.\n After defatting procedures, natural profiles and good appearances were restored, especially in patients in whom groin flaps were used.",
