  "text": "Ureteric catheterization in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis--an experimental evaluation.\n Experimental models of renal infections have been used to determine the accuracy with which the cellular and microbiologic components of ureteric and voided urine reflected the pathologic status of the kidney in pyelonephritis.\n In acute pyelonephritis, the composition of the ureteric urine reflected the pathologic status of the kidney, although in a few cases ureteric samples were either sterile or cell free.\n Animals with chronic pyelonephritis in which the lesions were either infected or sterile commonly had sterile ureteric urine.\n Pyuria, however, was demonstrable in both these situations.\n In subclinical pyelonephritis, ureteric samples from infected kidneys were variably culture positive, although pyuria was a common observation.\n Discriminate function analysis based on actual renal status and ureteric data gave an overall correct classification rate of 67% and demonstrated at least 80% agreement in four of the five classification groups.",
