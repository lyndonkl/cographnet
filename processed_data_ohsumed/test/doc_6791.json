  "text": "Contracturing granulomatous myositis: a separate entity.\n Granulomatous muscle disease is most commonly seen in sarcoidosis, but may be seen in association with a wide variety of other disorders or in isolation.\n Patients with granulomatous myositis usually present with slowly progressive muscle pain and weakness affecting mainly proximal muscles.\n There are, however, a few reports of granulomatous muscle disease presenting with flexion contractures of the limbs.\n Two further patients with granulomatous muscle disease and flexion contractures of the limbs, but with no evidence of systemic granulomatous disease, is presented.\n It is suggested that such patients represent a separate clinical entity that is distinct from idiopathic granulomatous myositis presenting with muscle pain and weakness.\n The association of contracturing granulomatous myositis with a long-standing vasculitis in one patient suggests that the two conditions may be related.",
