  "text": "Axillary lymphadenectomy for intraductal carcinoma of the breast.\n During a ten year period, 175 axillary lymph node dissections were done as part of the treatment for intraductal carcinoma of the breast; 98 patients were treated with modified radical mastectomy and 77 were treated by mammary preservation, consisting of excision of the lesion, axillary dissection and radiation therapy.\n One of 175 axillary node dissections yielded positive nodes.\n Axillary dissection for intraductal carcinoma of the breast is unlikely to yield involved nodes and is not indicated for use in most instances.\n It should be reserved for lesions demonstrating microinvasion.",
