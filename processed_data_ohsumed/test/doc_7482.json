  "text": "A dentist's dilemma: nonsurgical endodontic therapy or periapical surgery for teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion.\n First presented is a brief review of nonsurgical versus surgical treatment of radicular cysts.\n This is followed by a consideration of the use of radiographs for differential diagnosis of periapical radiolucent lesions.\n Some of the nonendodontic local and systemic lesions that can occur periapically are then presented.\n Next examined are the fallibilities of pulp vitality testing methods.\n The need for histopathologic examination of periapical lesions is the subject of the next discussion.\n The dentist's dilemma is then examined: should teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion have routine surgical treatment including biopsy or should they be treated nonsurgically and have periodic follow-ups? A possible resolution of this dilemma is the final consideration.",
