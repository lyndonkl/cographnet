  "text": "Intraepithelial anchoring fibril components.\n Cultured human keratinocytes and cultured human cervical carcinoma cells (ME-180) contained intracellular pools of antigens that reacted with the anchoring fibril antibodies AF1 and AF2.\n In keratinocytes, these antigens formed a basement membrane-like structure near the apical portions of the cells.\n Using flow cytometric techniques, pretreatment of the ME-180 cells with acetone revealed large intracellular pools of antigen.\n The intracellular epitope was calcium sensitive.\n Some forms of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa have retention of intracellular portions of the anchoring fibril suggesting a relation of the intracellular anchoring fibril antigens to that disease.",
