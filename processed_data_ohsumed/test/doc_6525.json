  "text": "Recombinant human erythropoietin and renal anemia: molecular biology, clinical efficacy, and nervous system effects \n Anemia (hematocrit less than 25%) predictably accompanies chronic renal failure and is present in over 90% of patients on chronic dialysis.\n Relative erythropoietin deficiency is the proximate cause.\n Recombinant human erythropoietin recently became available for research and clinical use.\n Erythropoietin production is regulated by a single copy gene located on chromosome 7; its expression has been shown in the kidney, liver, and macrophages.\n It is glycosylated protein of 166 amino acids with a molecular weight of 34,000 D.\n When given to patients with the anemia of renal failure, erythropoietin causes a dose-dependent rise in hematocrit to the normal range within 8 to 14 weeks.\n Complications of this response are minimal except for a significant incidence of hypertension.\n When the anemia is corrected, the patient's quality of life, cognitive function, and brain electrophysiology improve dramatically.\n Recombinant human erythropoietin represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure.\n Current reimbursement constraints limit its full application.",
