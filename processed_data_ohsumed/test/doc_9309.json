  "text": "Kenneth McKenzie, Harvey Cushing, and the early neurosurgical treatment of spasmodic torticollis.\n In 1923, Dr.\n Kenneth McKenzie trained at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital under Dr.\n Harvey Cushing.\n At that time, a patient with spasmodic torticollis came to Cushing and was treated with an innovative operation for this disorder with good results.\n This case sparked an interest in Dr.\n McKenzie, who published the case 1 year later.\n In reviewing the surgical histories from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, we have found the original records of this well-documented case.\n The record includes postoperative drawings of the intraoperative field by Dr.\n Cushing, a sketch by Dr.\n McKenzie illustrating the postoperative sensory examination, and pre- and postoperative photographs of the patient.",
