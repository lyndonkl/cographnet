  "text": "HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM) after blood transfusion in a patient with CD2+ hairy cell leukemia.\n Hairy cell leukemia complicating hemolytic anemia developed in a 46-year-old woman.\n Morphologically and cytochemically typical hairy cells were found to express both CD20 and CD2 antigens.\n Expression of surface IgG of kappa-chain type and the rearrangement of Ig but not T-cell receptor beta genes confirmed a B-cell origin of the leukemia.\n Blood transfusion was followed by disappearance of the hemolysis and a marked improvement of the leukemia.\n However, the patient developed progressive spastic spinal paraplegia about seven months after transfusion and was diagnosed as having HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM) by the demonstration of HTLV-I antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.\n HTLV-I infection via the transfusion may have been involved in the hematologic improvement seen in this patient.\n Autopsy showed demyelination, vacuolar degeneration, gliosis, and perivascular cuffing in the white matter of spinal cord without evidence of leukemic infiltration.",
