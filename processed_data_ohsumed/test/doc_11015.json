  "text": "Nitinol gooseneck snare for removal of foreign bodies: experimental study and clinical evaluation.\n The authors describe their use of a new right-angle snare made of nickel-titanium (nitinol) cable for retrieval of foreign bodies and iatrogenically placed devices.\n The snare loop is at right angles to the cable and comes in five sizes (5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 mm); its radiographic visualization is enhanced by gold-plated tungsten coils.\n This snare was used to retrieve wire and catheter fragments introduced into the thoracic vasculature of four dogs.\n Eleven of 13 attempts were successful.\n Three attempts to retrieve intravascular foreign bodies were successful in two patients; in one of these patients, a 10-mm snare was used to remove a fractured end of a ventriculoatrial shunt tube from the left pulmonary artery.\n In three other patients, four ureteral stents were successfully removed under fluoroscopic guidance.\n All retrievals were performed through a vascular sheath and with standard techniques and angiographic equipment.\n No complications were seen in any of the patients or dogs.",
