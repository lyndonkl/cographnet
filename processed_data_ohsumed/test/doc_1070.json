  "text": "The importance of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using electrocoagulation was successfully performed in 56 out of 58 selected patients.\n Cholangiography was performed in 53 patients.\n Six patients had common duct stones; five were unsuspected preoperatively.\n After the gallbladder was removed, three patients underwent open common duct exploration.\n In another five cases, anatomical anomalies were discovered.\n Cholangiography performed via the cystic duct before any structures are divided can prevent the most serious complication--common duct injury.\n Cholangiography should be attempted on all patients undergoing LC.",
