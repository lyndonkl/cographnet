  "text": "Elective diagnostic laparoscopy.\n Laparoscopy developed as a science at the turn of the century, and many scientists assisted in the evolution of this technique.\n However, it was many years before the multiple trocar system was developed that allowed internal organs to be moved and biopsies to be obtained.\n This has led to the development of numerous indications for elective diagnostic laparoscopy.\n Adequate preparation and attention to instrumentation ensure the safety of this operation.\n Elective diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful adjunct to many other diagnostic modalities such as, for instance, the assessment of abdominal pain, abdominal masses, fever of unknown origin, and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n In many other circumstances, such as the assessment of oncology cases, this modality is superior to conventional radiology because biopsy specimens may be obtained.\n If the procedure is correctly performed, the diagnostic yield is extremely high and the morbidity and mortality are low.\n The role of this important technique should not be underestimated by today's practicing surgeon.",
