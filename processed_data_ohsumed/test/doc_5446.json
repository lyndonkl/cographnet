  "text": "Echographic diagnosis of dural carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas.\n I used standardized ophthalmic echography to identify specific abnormalities in four patients with low-pressure, low-flow dural arteriovenous malformations.\n In all of the patients, B-scan ultrasonography showed engorgement of the ipsilateral vertical vein.\n A-scan ultrasonography dynamically imaged rapid blood flow through the superior ophthalmic vein and enlargement of the culpable ocular muscles in patients with restrictive ophthalmopathy.\n The 30-degree test distinguished between venous engorgement of the optic nerve sheath and apical compression of the optic nerve by enlarged ocular muscles.",
