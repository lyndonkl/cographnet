  "text": "Surgical removal of subfoveal neovascularization in the presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome.\n We treated two patients with presumed ocular histoplasmosis, subfoveal neovascular membranes, and progressive visual acuity loss to 20/400.\n Vitreoretinal surgical techniques were used to remove the subfoveal membranes.\n Visual acuity returned to 20/20 with seven months of follow-up in one patient (Case 1) and to 20/40 with three months of follow-up in the other patient (Case 2).\n No evidence of persistent or current subretinal neovascular membranes in either patient have been noted.\n These preliminary results suggest that vitreoretinal surgical techniques may be successful in mechanically removing subfoveal neovascular membranes with preservation of overlying neurosensory retina and thus preservation of central visual acuity.",
