  "text": "Fulminating multiple sclerosis-like leukoencephalopathy revealing human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n A 66-year-old French homosexual man and a 42-year-old Brazilian man with no known risk factors for HIV infection developed headaches, asthenia, and neurologic episodes of abrupt onset.\n CT showed multiple hypodense, nonenhancing lesions.\n Serology for HIV was positive.\n They died respectively 2 months and 1 month after onset of the illnesses.\n Autopsy in both cases showed multiple, well-demarcated, demyelinating foci in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum with histologic features characteristic of recent plaques of multiple sclerosis.\n There were no multinucleated giant cells or microglial nodules.\n Immunostaining for HIV was negative.\n Although a random coincidence of MS and HIV infection cannot be ruled out, the close temporal relationship between the 2 disorders suggests a possible etiologic association.",
