  "text": "A retrospective evaluation of 301 TMJ Proplast-Teflon implants.\n A retrospective review of 301 meniscectomies with Proplast-Teflon implants was performed.\n Factors such as interincisal opening, occlusion, joint sounds, joint degeneration, and patient satisfaction were examined.\n The overall surgical success rate was 88.7%, with an average follow-up period of 33 months.\n Although many patients demonstrated significant condylar degeneration at 1-year follow-up, such change did not necessarily result in symptomatology or joint dysfunction.\n Only 10% of implants resulted in removal.\n Surgical and postoperative procedures are contrasted with those of other clinicians experiencing lower success rates.",
