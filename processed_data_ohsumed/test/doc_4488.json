  "text": "Recurrent acute glomerulonephritis.\n Biopsy-proven recurrent acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) is extremely rare and is usually seen in children with acute, well-defined streptococcal infections.\n We present here a patient with recurrent AGN in the absence of chronic bacterial infection.\n The subject, an 80-year-old man, had eight episodes of acute nephritic syndrome following upper respiratory tract infection.\n No abnormalities were detected during remissions.\n Renal biopsies during two of those episodes showed typical postinfectious acute exsudative endocapillary glomerulonephritis, while results of another biopsy performed during remission were normal.",
