  "text": "Recovery from disturbed colonic transit time after alcohol withdrawal.\n The effects of alcohol withdrawal on total and segmental transit time were evaluated in 20 chronic alcoholic subjects.\n After withdrawal, colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24.9 +/- 3.6 to 33.3 +/- 4.5 hours mean +/- SE (P less than 0.01).\n This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001).\n No variations were found in right or left colon transit time.\n Distal colonic motility is thus a crucial factor in the genesis of diarrhea in chronic alcoholic subjects.",
