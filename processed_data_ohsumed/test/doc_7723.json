  "text": "The use of L-dopa and carbidopa in metastatic malignant melanoma.\n A combination of L-dopa and carbidopa was given orally to 17 patients with metastatic melanoma.\n Maximum tolerated oral doses were given, up to 4 grams daily.\n No response was seen in 15 patients evaluable for response.\n Toxicity was considerable, with seven of 17 patients (41%) stopping treatment because of unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity or postural hypotension.\n Contrary to previous anecdotal reports, there was no evidence that L-dopa/carbidopa treatment resulted in accelerated progression of metastatic melanoma.\n Orally administered L-dopa/carbidopa is ineffective as therapy for advanced melanoma when maximum tolerated doses are used.",
