  "text": "Acute oculogyric crisis after administration of prochlorperazine.\n We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection.\n Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis.\n Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions.\n Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men.\n Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions.\n Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction.",
