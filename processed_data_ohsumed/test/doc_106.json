  "text": "Detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b antigens in the serum and urine of patients with pneumonia in Papua New Guinea: comparison of latex agglutination and counterimmunoelectrophoresis.\n Latex agglutination (LA) was compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for the diagnosis of pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae type b in children less than 6 years old in Papua New Guinea.\n Neither LA nor CIE was sufficiently sensitive for the detection of pneumococcal antigens.\n CIE was superior to LA but had a sensitivity of only 60% (six of 10) in concentrated urine and a specificity of 90% (54 of 60).\n LA for the detection of H.\n influenzae type b had a sensitivity of 100% (eight of eight) relative to that of blood culture and a specificity of 99% (112 of 113) when urine diluted fivefold was tested, as compared with a sensitivity of 100% (nine of nine) and a specificity of 92% (56 of 61) in undiluted urine.\n Undiluted and concentrated urine specimens were unsuitable for LA because of the many false-positive reactions that resulted from nasal carriage of H.\n influenzae type b and nasal carriage of the cross-reactive S.\n pneumoniae type 6.\n CIE for the detection of H.\n influenzae type b had a sensitivity of only 44% (four of nine) in concentrated urine.",
