  "text": "Molecular characterization of erythrocyte glycophorin C variants.\n Human erythrocyte glycophorin C plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane mechanical stability.\n Immunochemical and serologic studies have identified a number of glycophorin C variants that include the Yus, Gerbich, and Webb phenotypes.\n We report here the molecular characterization of these variants.\n Amplification of glycophorin C mRNA from the Yus phenotype, using two oligonucleotide primers that span the coding domain, generated a 338-bp fragment compared with a 395-bp fragment generated by amplification of normal glycophorin C mRNA.\n Sequencing of the mutant 338-bp fragment identified a 57-bp deletion that corresponds to exon 2 of the glycophorin C gene.\n Similar analysis showed deletion of 84-bp exon 3 in the Gerbich phenotype.\n In contrast to the generation of shorter than normal DNA fragments from mRNA amplification in the Yus and Gerbich phenotypes, amplification of mRNA from the Webb phenotype generated a normal-sized fragment.\n Sequencing of this DNA fragment showed an A----G substitution at nucleotide 23 of the coding sequence, resulting in the substitution of asparagine by serine.\n This modification accounts for the altered glycosylation of glycophorin C seen in this phenotype.\n These results have enabled us to characterize glycophorin C variants in three different phenotypes that involve deletions of exons 2 and 3 of the glycophorin C gene, as well as a point mutation in exon 1 that results in altered glycosylation of this protein.",
