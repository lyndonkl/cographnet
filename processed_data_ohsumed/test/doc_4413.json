  "text": "Patients' expectations of patient-controlled analgesia.\n Patient-controlled analgesia is an increasingly popular method of postoperative pain relief.\n However, patients often worry about new therapies.\n Eighty ASA 1 and 2 patients aged 18-65 years were asked to list the advantages and disadvantages of using patient-controlled analgesia.\n The most important advantage as perceived by patients was the reduced time spent by nurses in giving medication, but there was concern that direct personal contact would also be lessened.\n Preservation of self control, autonomy, rapid onset of analgesia, ability to titrate analgesia and lack of injections were seen as an advantage.\n Addiction and machine faults were seen as minimal problems.\n Preservation of patient-nurse contact is of great importance to ensure success of postoperative analgesia.",
