  "text": "Internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. Two methods compared.\n In a prospective randomised study, the Hansson pin technique for internal fixation of fractures of the femoral neck was compared with the Uppsala screw technique.\n The series consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 97 women and 18 men, with a mean age of 80 years.\n There were 56 patients treated with Hansson pins and 59 with Uppsala screws.\n After one year 22 patients had died, eight in the Hansson pin group and 14 in the Uppsala screw group (p = 0.28).\n Twenty-four complications had occurred, 18 in the Hansson pin group and six in the Uppsala screw group (p = 0.008).\n After exclusion of those with complications, the patients in the Hansson pin group had significantly more pain, less mobility, and a smaller proportion were living in their own homes.",
