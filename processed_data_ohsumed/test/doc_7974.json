  "text": "Using a state cancer registry to increase screening behaviors of sisters and daughters of breast cancer patients.\n The Pennsylvania Cancer Registry was used to contact breast cancer patients and, through them, their adult sisters and daughters.\n The sisters and daughters were counseled concerning their higher than average risks for breast cancer and their need for mammography and breast self-examination.\n Results showed a 9 percent increase in mammography and a 10 percent increase in breast self-examination rates for the counseled over control group.\n Costs were $49 per counseled sister or daughter indicating a need to increase cost effectiveness before implementation is practical.",
