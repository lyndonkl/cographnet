  "text": "The effect of doxazosin on platelet aggregation in normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension: an in vitro study.\n An in vitro assay was used to investigate the effects of doxazosin on the platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate.\n Platelet-rich plasma from normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension was compared.\n Doxazosin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in both groups, but significantly lower concentrations were required to inhibit platelet aggregation in plasma taken from patients with hypertension.\n The concentrations of doxazosin that inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro were similar to those that are used clinically to control blood pressure in patients with hypertension.",
