  "text": "Isolated subclavian artery dissection after blunt trauma.\n We present a case report of a patient with an isolated dissection of the subclavian artery after blunt trauma.\n The patient who was admitted to our center after a motor vehicle accident, complained of chest and neck pain and physical findings of diminished left extremity pulses.\n Arteriography showed an occluded subclavian artery with the possibility of a dissection.\n The dissection was confirmed at surgery with the proximal extent originating just distal to the origin of the vertebral artery.\n The distal extent of the dissection was not determined.\n Operative repair was performed by a carotid-to-subclavian artery bypass obliterating the false lumen of the dissection with a running vascular anastomosis.\n The patient, who was discharged 5 days after repair, had normal extremity neurovascular function at 4 months follow-up.",
