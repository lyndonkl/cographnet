  "text": "Postoperative urinary tract infection in gynecology: implications for an antibiotic prophylaxis policy.\n A prospective observational study of postoperative infection after gynecologic surgery assessed the need for antibiotic prophylaxis with special reference to the urinary tract.\n Catheterization requirements in the postoperative period were compared with the development of urinary tract infection after excluding both preoperative and postoperative bacteriuria.\n Forty-six of 115 patients (40%) developed a urinary tract infection in the postoperative period.\n Furthermore, this was not clearly related to the need for postoperative catheterization.\n Significant wound and vaginal vault infections were uncommon, indicating that antibiotic prophylaxis should be directed specifically at the urinary tract.",
