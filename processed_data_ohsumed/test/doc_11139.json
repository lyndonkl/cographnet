  "text": "Charcot's disease in diabetic patients. Correct diagnosis can prevent progressive deformity.\n Although Charcot's disease and its association with diabetes have been described many times in the literature, it is still often misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated as osteomyelitis, arthritis, or gout.\n The best safeguard is a high index of suspicion.\n A warm, swollen foot in a diabetic patient with long-standing neuropathy without local or systemic signs of infection must be considered Charcot's disease until proven otherwise.\n The principal treatment is total abstinence from putting weight on the foot until warmth, swelling, and redness subside.\n Protective weight-bearing methods may then be slowly instituted.",
