  "text": "The mec-4 gene is a member of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans genes that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration \n Three dominant mutations of mec-4, a gene needed for mechanosensation, cause the touch-receptor neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans to degenerate.\n With deg-1, another C.\n elegans gene that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration and that is similar in sequence, mec-4 defines a new gene family.\n Cross-hybridizing sequences are detectable in other species, raising the possibility that degenerative conditions in other organisms may be caused by mutations in similar genes.\n All three dominant mec-4 mutations affect the same amino acid.\n Effects of amino-acid substitutions at this position suggest that steric hindrance may induce the degenerative state.",
