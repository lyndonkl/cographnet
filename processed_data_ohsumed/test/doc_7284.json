  "text": "Scapular allografts. A report of two cases.\n Some malignant tumors of the scapula can be adequately treated by limb-sparing, partial, or total scapulectomy.\n However, resection of the glenoid portion of the scapula and total scapulectomy result in an unsightly shoulder.\n In an attempt to minimize the functional impairment and restore stability and cosmesis, scapular glenoid allografts offer a reasonably good biologic replacement.\n This report describes the cases of a 45-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man in whom massive osteoarticular allografts were used.\n In one patient, good stability, cosmesis, and function were restored after resection of the glenoid portion.\n In the other patient, shoulder stability, cosmesis, and limited function were restored after total scapulectomy.\n No reports of scapular allografts seem to have been previously published in the literature.",
