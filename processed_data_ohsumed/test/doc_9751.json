  "text": "A comparison of midazolam with and without nalbuphine for intravenous sedation.\n The introduction of nalbuphine to intravenous sedation with midazolam added little to the quality of sedation for short operative procedures.\n There was a greater tendency for patients who received nalbuphine and midazolam to sleep in the afternoon after treatment compared with those who received only midazolam.\n Significantly more patients had nausea and vomiting in the midazolam/nalbuphine group than did patients in the midazolam-only group.",
