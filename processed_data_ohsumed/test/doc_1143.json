  "text": "Alanine aminotransferase in clinical practice. A review.\n Alanine aminotransferase is an enzyme produced mainly in the liver.\n When serum activity is measured, it provides a marker of hepatic disease.\n This review explores the biochemistry and laboratory analysis of alanine aminotransferase in terms of its significance in human health and disease.\n Cut-off levels that define abnormality are rather arbitrary and this decreases the specificity of the test in apparently healthy patients.\n A small, but important, group of patients with alanine aminotransferase abnormality have underlying liver disease that may be treatable.\n Most can be diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and biochemical-serological profiles.\n Liver biopsy can complement the diagnostic process in selected circumstances.\n Literature pertaining to this is critically reviewed.",
