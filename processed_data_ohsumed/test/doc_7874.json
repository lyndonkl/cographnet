  "text": "Autopsy-documented cure of multiple myeloma 14 years after M2 chemotherapy.\n Multiple myeloma was diagnosed in a 65-year-old woman in 1974 who thereafter received five-drug M2 chemotherapy.\n All protein abnormalities subsequently returned to normal and serial bone marrow studies documented complete bone marrow remission.\n Destructive bone lesions persisted radiographically, but did not progress.\n In 1987, a localized sigmoid adenocarcinoma was resected.\n In 1988, the patient presented with multiple brain metastases associated with a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma that proved rapidly fatal.\n At autopsy, no evidence of multiple myeloma was found.\n This report describes the first tissue-documented cure of multiple myeloma 14 years after diagnosis and initiation of M2 chemotherapy.\n The possible association of multiple myeloma with other malignancies is also discussed.",
