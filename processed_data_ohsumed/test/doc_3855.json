  "text": "A randomised double-blind study of interpleural analgesia after cholecystectomy.\n Continuous interpleural analgesia provided by 4 hourly injections of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% with adrenaline 5 micrograms/ml was compared with placebo in a randomised, double-blind study after cholecystectomy.\n All patients self-administered intravenous morphine using a patient-controlled analgesia device.\n There was a highly significant difference in mean morphine consumption between the groups (72 mg as compared with 22 mg).\n Visual analogue pain scores tended to be lower in the bupivacaine group throughout and this was significant at 2 hours.\n Respiratory function measurements were not significantly different between the groups.\n The mean peak venous plasma bupivacaine concentration after the sixth dose was 3.03 micrograms/ml and no symptoms suggestive of local anaesthetic toxicity occurred.\n It is concluded that this regimen can provide effective and continuous analgesia after cholecystectomy and that combined administration of interpleural bupivacaine and systemic morphine is more effective than morphine alone in the immediate postoperative period.\n The doses of bupivacaine required for optimal use of the technique lead to significant total plasma bupivacaine concentrations within 24 hours.",
