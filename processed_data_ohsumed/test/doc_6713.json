  "text": "Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome terminating as disseminated T-cell lymphoma.\n The authors describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) terminated as a T-cell lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl.\n The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis.\n Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney.\n The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma.\n Other possible sequences are discussed.\n The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation.",
