  "text": "Substance abuse education in pediatrics.\n Historically, physicians have received little formal education related to alcohol or other drug abuse and dependence.\n A survey of all pediatric programs in the United States was conducted to assess the current status of alcohol/drug education in pediatrics.\n At the medical student and residency training levels, only 44% and 40% of programs, respectively, required any formal instruction, and only 27% and 34%, respectively, offered an elective for medical students or residents.\n Although most respondents endorsed the inclusion of both required and elective alcohol and drug education in the curriculum, few programs that did not include it already had a future plan for it.\n Major impediments identified were curriculum time constraints (86% medical student level, 68% resident level) and the lack of a qualified instructor (55% medical student level, 50% resident level).\n The survey results suggest a strong need for development of faculty and structured alcohol and drug abuse educational plans specific to pediatrics.",
