  "text": "Effect of hydrocephalus on prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid.\n The concentrations of prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin E2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (prostacyclin metabolite), and thromboxane B2 were assayed in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 28 patients with hydrocephalus (17 obstructive, 11 communicating).\n Seven patients received dexamethasone or hydrocortisone on the day of sampling.\n No patient received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds for 48 hours before sampling.\n The median values did not differ significantly between the two types of hydrocephalus or from the concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients without intracranial pathology during lumbar myelography for possible lumbar disc disease.\n Hence, there is no evidence that eicosanoids accumulate in the ventricles in hydrocephalus, and it is unlikely that they have a significant role in its symptomatology.",
