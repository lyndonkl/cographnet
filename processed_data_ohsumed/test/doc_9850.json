  "text": "Heart rate changes as an autonomic component of the pain response.\n Autonomic variables have been recommended as measures of the affective-motivational component of the pain response in objective algesimetry.\n In the present study components of heart rate responses to painful heat stimuli and their relation to stimulus and sensation variables were analyzed.\n Twelve healthy subjects served.\n Sixty phasic stimuli of varying temperatures above and below pain threshold were delivered through a Marstock thermode in 1 session.\n Heart rate, respiration, and subjective stimulus ratings were recorded simultaneously.\n Phasic heat stimulation above and below pain threshold induced a tonic increase of the heart rate lasting up to more than 20 sec.\n High intensity stimulation generated steeper rises and greater mean increase than low intensity stimulation.\n In general, heart rate responses were more closely related to subjective sensation than to stimulus intensity.\n However, differential temporal analysis demonstrates that, until about 3 sec after stimulation, the autonomic response is determined solely by stimulus temperature, whereas, after approximately 6 sec, it is related only to subjective judgement.\n Accordingly, the heart rate responses reflect both a brief nocifensive reflex induced by the sensory component and, subsequently, a longer-lasting response which seems to be related to affective and/or cognitive evaluation.\n This separation of different stages of pain-processing by an autonomic indicator may be useful in clinical algesimetry.",
