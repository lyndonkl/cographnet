  "text": "Spinal cord stimulation: a contemporary series \n Forty-three patients with chronic pain disorders of different causes were selected for spinal cord stimulation.\n All underwent implantation of a ribbon electrode through a small laminotomy, under general anesthesia.\n Thirteen patients (30%) failed to obtain significant pain relief during a period of trial stimulation, and their electrodes were removed.\n The remainder underwent a definitive implant and were followed for a mean of 13 months (range, 3-33 months).\n Nineteen of them (63%) continued to experience pain relief.\n A detailed analysis of this series, as well as a literature review, is presented.",
