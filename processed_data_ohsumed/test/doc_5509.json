  "text": "Relationship among level of distraction, evoked potentials, spinal cord ischemia and integrity, and clinical status in animals.\n Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and neurogenic-motor evoked potentials (NMEPs) were recorded after overdistraction of the spinal cord at T5-T6, T12-L1, or L3-L4.\n Measures of spinal cord perfusion and clinical status were also administered.\n Results indicated that stiffer spinal segments allowed less distraction than more flexible segments.\n SEPs and NMEPs were lost quickly after overdistraction in stiff segments and slowly in more flexible segments.\n However, SEPs were less sensitive than NMEPs to effects from overdistraction.\n Spinal cord perfusion and integrity were consistent with reduced perfusion and structural damage after overdistraction in stiff segments; extremely reduced perfusion but no structural changes in more flexible segments.\n The application of these results to the clinical situation was provided.",
