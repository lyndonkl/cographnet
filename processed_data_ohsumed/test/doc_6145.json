  "text": "Diabetic nephropathy: changing concepts of pathogenesis and treatment.\n The metabolic changes which accompany hyperglycemia in a person with diabetes are thought to cause renal hyperperfusion and intraglomerular hypertension, especially in the person with a predisposition to essential hypertension.\n Intraglomerular hypertension causing deposition of protein in the mesangium leads to glomerulosclerosis and renal failure.\n Screening for microalbuminuria can predict which type I diabetic patients will develop nephropathy.\n The decline in renal function in established diabetic nephropathy can be slowed with aggressive treatment of hypertension.\n The use of ACE inhibitors may also decrease intraglomerular hypertension.\n Whether similar treatment in the person with preclinical diabetic nephropathy would delay or prevent the onset of diabetic nephropathy is being investigated.\n Restricted protein intake, anti-platelet and rheolitic drugs may have a role in the treatment of established diabetic nephropathy.\n In end stage renal failure, renal transplantation is the treatment of choice.\n When transplantation cannot be performed, chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is preferable to hemodialysis.",
