  "text": "Microbial agents associated with pneumonia in children from Uruguay.\n The etiology of severe pneumonia, not frequently encountered in a community-based study, was determined in 204 hospitalized children less than 5 years of age.\n Potential pathogens were identified in 41% of episodes.\n Viruses were isolated or antigen was detected in 36.3% of cases; 82.4% of these cases were due to respiratory syncytial virus.\n Bacteria or bacterial antigens were identified in 13.2% of cases; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most frequently identified bacterial pathogens isolated from blood and/or pleural effusions.\n Mixed infections were identified in 4.9% of the episodes.\n Among the 17 patients with pleural effusion whose pleural space was drained, the etiology was suggested for 10 (58.8%).\n A clear-cut seasonal variation was seen, with the highest prevalence between May and October.\n Viral infections were more common in the first 6 months of life, although viral and bacterial infections were distributed throughout the first 5 years of life.",
