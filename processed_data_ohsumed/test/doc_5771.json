  "text": "Ruptured mature cystic teratoma of the ovary with recurrence in the liver and colon 17 years later. A case report.\n A mature cystic teratoma of the ovary occurred in a 51-year-old woman and recurred as a large intrahepatic tumor mass as well as a small mass in the transverse colon 17 years after rupture, intraperitoneal spillage of tumor contents and subtotal surgical removal of the ovarian lesion and peritoneal implants.\n The patient was treated with a partial hepatectomy and a segmental transverse colectomy.\n The recurrent lesions, which contained histologically fully mature teratomatous elements only, were excised; the result was a complete cure.\n To our knowledge this is the first documented report on such a complication of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary.",
