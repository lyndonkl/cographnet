  "text": "Extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation after scleral buckling surgery.\n We reviewed the records of 28 patients who had undergone successful scleral buckling surgery followed by extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of an intraocular lens.\n Posterior chamber intraocular lenses were inserted in 27 eyes, and anterior chamber intraocular lenses were inserted in two eyes with posterior capsule rupture at the time of surgery.\n The mean follow-up period was 44 months.\n Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15 of 29 eyes (52%).\n One eye (3.4%) developed a recurrent retinal detachment 15 months after cataract surgery.\n Two eyes (6.9%) developed angiographically proven cystoid macular edema.\n The outcome for extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in eyes that had previously undergone successful scleral buckling for retinal detachment is favorable.",
