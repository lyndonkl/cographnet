  "text": "Sinus node-atrioventricular node isolation: long-term results with the \"corridor\" operation for atrial fibrillation \n The \"corridor\" operation is designed to restore sinus rhythm to patients with atrial fibrillation by electrically isolating the sinus node, a band of atrial tissue and the atrioventricular (AV) node from the remaining atrial tissue.\n Nine patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation underwent this operation; four patients had chronic atrial fibrillation and five had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the mean duration of symptoms was 12 +/- 8 years.\n Patient ages ranged from 25 to 68 years (mean 48 +/- 12).\n At preoperative electrophysiologic study, no patient had evidence of an accessory AV pathway or AV node reentry.\n Sinus node recovery time could not be determined in five patients because of recurrent atrial fibrillation during or before programmed stimulation.\n At operation the corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes was successfully isolated from the remaining left and right atrial tissue in all patients.\n One patient required early reoperation for recurrent atrial fibrillation before hospital discharge.\n At the predischarge electrophysiologic study, the corridor remained isolated in all patients except for one patient who had intermittent conduction between the corridor and excluded right atrium.\n One patient had nonsustained atrial fibrillation and one had atrial tachycardia evident in the corridor.\n Atypical AV node reentry of uncertain significance was induced in one other patient.\n Over a total follow-up of 191 patient months (mean 21 +/- 20), seven patients remained free of atrial fibrillation.\n Two patients had recurrent atrial fibrillation, which in one patient was effectively controlled by a single antiarrhythmic agent.\n A permanent pacemaker was implanted in four patients for sinus node dysfunction.",
