  "text": "Poverty and HIV seropositivity: the poor are more likely to be infected.\n We analyzed demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV seropositivity using data from 3601 clients of the main HIV counseling and testing clinic for high-risk people in Seattle, Washington, USA.\n Clients with lower income were found to be more likely to be HIV seropositive, before and after controlling for other demographic and risk factors with logistic regression.\n This result supports the hypothesis that the impoverished are at increased risk for HIV infection due to the physical and social circumstances in which their poverty places them.\n These may include poor access to risk-reduction information and less support for implementation of risk-reduction strategies.",
