  "text": "Flexible cystoscopy as an adjunct to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.\n Ancillary procedures associated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) include placement and subsequent removal of double pigtail ureteric stents.\n A simple new technique has been developed for the insertion of these stents.\n Using the flexible cystoscope, the procedure is performed on an out-patient basis under local anaesthesia.\n Placement of the stents was successful in 30/34 patients and removal was successful in 14/14 patients.",
