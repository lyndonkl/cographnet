  "text": "Immunohistochemical demonstration of keratin in ameloblastoma as an indication of tumor differentiation.\n Keratin expression was studied immunohistochemically in 27 ameloblastomas using polyclonal antibody against wide-spectrum keratins (TTL) and monoclonal antibodies against lower- and higher-molecular-weight keratins (PKK1 and KL1), respectively, to clarify the tumor differentiation.\n Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas.\n Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1.\n On the other hand, the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent.\n From these facts, it was concluded that the follicular, as well as acanthomatous, ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation, whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation.",
