  "text": "Plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity treated by radiation therapy.\n Plasma cell granuloma is a rare, benign tumor most commonly found in the lungs in patients younger than 30 years.\n Although presentation has been reported at a number of other anatomic sites, this report is the first of plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity.\n The tumor was initially resected, but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up.\n Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring, 40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique.\n Most recent clinical follow-up at 27 months showed local control.\n Surgery remains the treatment of choice for plasma cell granuloma when the disease can be completely resected.\n However, irradiation can also be effective in patients with recurrent or inoperable local disease.",
