  "text": "Delayed-onset pseudophakic endophthalmitis.\n We reviewed 19 cases of delayed-onset pseudophakic endophthalmitis in which diagnostic cultures were performed at one month or more after cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.\n We isolated four different organisms in these 19 cases: 12 Propionibacterium species (63%), three Candida parapsilosis (16%), three Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), and one Corynebacterium species (5%).\n Because of the unusual delayed-onset features of these cases and the retrospective nature of this study, a variety of treatment regimens were used.\n Twelve patients had recurrence of marked inflammation despite an apparent initial cure, and ten of these patients had positive culture results on repeat examination of intraocular fluids.\n Nine patients continued to be treated with topical corticosteroids postoperatively to suppress low-grade inflammation.\n Of the 19 patients, 16 had final visual acuity of 20/400 or better.\n Delayed-onset pseudophakic endophthalmitis had a more favorable visual prognosis, compared to acute-onset endophthalmitis.",
