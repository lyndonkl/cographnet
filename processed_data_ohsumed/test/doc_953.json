  "text": "Asialoglycoprotein receptor function in benign liver disease: evaluation with MR imaging.\n An arabinogalactan-coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (AG-USPIO) preparation specific for asialoglycoprotein (ASG) receptors on hepatocytes was used as a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent in the evaluation of a spectrum of benign liver diseases in animal models.\n The activity of hepatocyte ASG receptors, which directly reflects liver function, was directly assessed by measuring liver relaxation times in vitro and MR signal intensity in vivo.\n The following measurements allowed three-dimensional assessment of liver function: (a) liver relaxation time, (b) native MR signal intensities of liver, (c) response of liver to the AG-USPIO probe (percentage decrease of liver signal intensity after intravenous administration of 10 mumol/kg of AG-USPIO: normal liver 55%, fatty liver 57%, acute hepatitis 36%, chronic hepatitis 29%, and cirrhosis 46%), and (d) redistribution of hepatocyte-specific AG-USPIO to the spleen (present in hepatitis and cirrhosis but not in normal liver and fatty liver).\n The results of this study indicate that cellular hepatic abnormalities can be detected and quantitated with MR receptor imaging.",
