  "text": "Selective fallopian tube canalization.\n Infertility is an increasingly common problem.\n Occlusion of the fallopian tubes is one of the principal causes, and until recently surgery was the only available treatment.\n The success rate of surgery is often low, particularly with occlusion of the proximal tube.\n Selective fallopian tube canalization under fluoroscopic guidance has been successful in alleviating proximal tubal obstruction.\n This procedure may be performed in the outpatient setting and is a safe, cost-effective alternative to surgery.",
