  "text": "A simple transposition procedure for complicated strabismus.\n We combined a recession or resection of recti muscles with a vertical or horizontal transposition to correct a complicated paralytic ocular deviation in eight patients.\n The transposed muscles were reattached to the globe parallel to the spiral of Tillaux and adjacent to the paralyzed muscle.\n Postoperatively, seven patients demonstrated fusion in the primary position or required a slight head turn to fuse.\n There were no surgical complications, and no patient developed symptomatic cyclotropia, diplopia, or anterior segment ischemia.",
