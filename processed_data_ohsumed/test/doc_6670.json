  "text": "Antenatal intervention for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.\n In 2 fetuses with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) with hydrops, in-utero resection of the enlarged pulmonary lobe reduced mediastinal shift and allowed expansion of normal lung tissue in both cases.\n In case 1, the 27-week-gestation fetus died from severe hydrops after premature delivery.\n In case 2, fetal CCAM resection was completed at 23 weeks' gestation.\n At 30 weeks a girl was delivered with no evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia.\n Fetal surgery can now be entertained for otherwise fatal space-occupying intrathoracic lesions.",
