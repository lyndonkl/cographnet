  "text": "Further experience in rehabilitation of zone II flexor tendon repair with dynamic traction splinting.\n A review of all flexor tendon repairs in the \"no man's land\" performed from January of 1985 to June of 1987 was done to evaluate the efficacy of our method of rehabilitation.\n There were 60 fingers (57 patients) with complete laceration of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis tendons in zone II.\n Fingers with phalangeal fractures, joint injuries, or significant skin loss were excluded.\n Follow-up ranged from 12 to 48 months.\n Rehabilitation consisted of a 12-week protocol using the U.S.\n military combined regimen of controlled motion.\n Features from the technique of controlled active extension against rubber band passive flexion as well as those of controlled passive extension and passive flexion were incorporated.\n The palmar pulley modification of Kleinert's dynamic traction splint was utilized.\n Strickland's total active motion formula was employed to determine results.\n The results were classified into the four categories of excellent, good, fair, and poor.\n Fifty-two fingers (86 percent) were rated excellent, 4 fingers (7 percent) were rated good, 1 finger (2 percent) was rated fair, and 3 fingers (5 percent) were rated poor.",
