  "text": "Costs of operating a supported work program for traumatically brain-injured individuals.\n This paper presents a preliminary analysis of costs associated with a return-to-work program emphasizing a supported employment approach for persons who had sustained severe traumatic brain injuries.\n This analysis spans almost three years.\n Results indicated that a mean of 237.8 hours of staff intervention time was required to achieve job stabilization, at a cost of +6896.\n Ongoing follow-along and support services averaged 1.64 hours per week at a cost of +47.56.\n Over 68% of total staff time and costs were expended in job-site training and advocacy efforts.\n Application of these findings to state-level and agency-level policies should be weighed against individual characteristics and needs of clients, program design, and outcomes which clients achieve as a result of services.",
