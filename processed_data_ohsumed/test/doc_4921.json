  "text": "Urological complications in 350 consecutive renal transplants.\n Ten urological complications (2.9%) were found in 350 kidney transplants performed in this centre.\n These included obstructive uropathy (20%), urinary leaks (40%), distal uretic fistulas (necrosis) (30%) and renal calculi (10%).\n Two grafts were lost due to chronic rejection 9 and 30 months post-operatively.\n The remaining 8 patients have stable renal function (mean creatinine 1.5 mg%).\n It was concluded that meticulous surgical technique may reduce the number of urological complications and early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment may help to save the grafts.",
