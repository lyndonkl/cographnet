  "text": "Null cell adenoma of the pituitary with features of plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation.\n The case of a 35-year-old man with pituitary macroadenoma who was complaining of reduced sexual activity is presented.\n Histologic examination showed a chromophobic adenoma corresponding mainly to a null cell adenoma at the ultrastructural level.\n Focal plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation of adenoma cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic studies.\n It is suggested that adenomatous null cells represent pluripotent progenitor cells capable of transforming to different hormone-producing cell types.\n The factors accounting for differentiating to various cell populations have yet to be elucidated.",
