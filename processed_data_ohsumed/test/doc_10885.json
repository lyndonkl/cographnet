  "text": "Children of alcoholic parents in the community.\n The relationship between parental alcoholism and risk for maladjustment in the offspring was investigated in a community sample.\n Children of parents who met criteria for DIS/DSM-III alcohol abuse or dependence and children of parents who met criteria for ten other diagnoses were compared to children of \"normal\" parents.\n The data were obtained from the merging of the data banks of two major psychiatric epidemiology studies of the adult (17-64) and child (4-16) population of Puerto Rico.\n Results indicated that parental alcoholism in addition to creating an adverse family environment had an effect on the relative risk for maladjustment in the offspring (as measured by scores on the Child Behavior Checklist).\n Although previous studies have reported higher levels of externalizing behaviors in children of alcoholics, an increased risk for internalizing symptoms was observed in the children studied.\n Similar findings were obtained for the children of parents with other psychiatric disorders suggesting that the effects of parental alcoholism in children ages 4 to 16 may not be different from the consequences of parental mental illness per se.",
