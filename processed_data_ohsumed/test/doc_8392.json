  "text": "Long-term follow-up in toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodules treated with radioactive iodine \n The long-term effects of radioiodine treatment on thyroid function in patients with a toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodule were evaluated.\n Fifty-two patients received a therapeutic dose of 20 mCi of iodine-131 (131I).\n Duration of follow-up was 10 +/- 4 yr.\n Follow-up data included a biochemical evaluation of thyroid function.\n The failure rate (recurrent hyperthyroidism) was 2%.\n The incidence of hypothyroidism was 6% and was not related to the dose per gram of nodular tissue.\n Oral administration of 20 mCi of radioiodine is a simple and highly effective method for the treatment of patients with a toxic autonomous thyroid nodule.\n The risk of development of hypothyroidism is low if extranodular uptake of 131I is prevented.\n This can be achieved by not treating euthyroid patients, by no longer using injections of exogenous thyroid stimulating hormone in the diagnostic work-up of the patients and by always performing radioiodine imaging shortly before treatment.",
