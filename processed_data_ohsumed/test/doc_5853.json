  "text": "Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases.\n We describe 5 patients with a relapsing encephalopathy in association with Hashimoto's disease and high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies.\n The presentation is usually with a subacute onset of confusion, alteration in conscious level, and focal or generalized seizures.\n The relapsing course, association with myoclonus or tremulousness, and episodes of stroke-like deterioration are characteristic features.\n The long-term prognosis is favorable with steroid therapy, though additional immunosuppressive therapy may be required.\n Neurologic investigation typically shows a diffusely abnormal EEG, high CSF protein level without pleocytosis, and normal brain CT and cerebral angiogram.\n Isotope brain scan may show patchy abnormal uptake.\n Hashimoto's encephalopathy should be recognized as a definite neurologic entity and added to the list of CNS complications of thyroid disease.",
