  "text": "Ten-year results of operations for rheumatoid cervical spine disorders.\n The outcome of operations performed on 38 patients for rheumatoid disorders of the cervical spine were analysed 10 or more years later.\n The mean age of the patients at the time of operation was 56 years (35 to 77); 32 had seropositive disease.\n The mean duration of the disease was 17 years (four to 36).\n Twenty-seven patients had painful anterior atlanto-axial subluxation (AAS), nine had subaxial subluxation alone and two had severe cranial subluxation of the odontoid, one also with subaxial subluxation.\n One patient died from postoperative staphylococcal septicaemia and another 18 died during the follow-up period.\n Patients with coincident cardiac or other diseases, and those with cranial subluxation of the odontoid of more than 3 mm had an increased mortality.\n Neither the patients' age nor the magnitude of AAS correlated with mortality.\n Of the 37 patients with occipitocervical pain, 30 were relieved and all the six patients with tetraparesis were improved.\n Of the 24 Gallie fusions only 12 were solidly united; patients with long-term cortisone treatment were more likely to develop pseudarthrosis.\n There was no correlation between clinical outcome and radiological result.\n Four patients had further operations to treat subluxation which developed below the fused segments.",
