  "text": "Comparison of two preparatory techniques for urine cytology.\n Two methods of preparation of urine for cytology were compared retrospectively.\n In method 1 cells in the urine were fixed after the preparation of the smear; in method 2 the cells were fixed before smear preparation.\n Urine cytology reports were correlated with subsequent histological analysis.\n The specificities of urine cytology using both methods were high (99%).\n The sensitivity using method 1 was 87%; using method 2 it was 65%.\n This difference was significant.\n The cell preparation technique therefore significantly changes the sensitivity of urine cytology.\n Cellular fixation after smear preparation is preferable to smear preparation after fixation.",
