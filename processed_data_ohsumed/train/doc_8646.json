  "text": "Rigid fixation of internal orbital fractures.\n When large portions of the internal orbit are destroyed (two to four walls), standard bone-grafting techniques for immediate and late orbital reconstruction may not yield predictable eye position.\n Critical bone support is most often deficient inferomedially.\n CT analysis of orbital volume in cases where eye position was unsatisfactory reveals that displacement of bone grafts is one mechanism of the unsatisfactory result.\n Other mechanisms include undercorrection and bone-graft resorption.\n In order to minimize postoperative bone-graft displacement, titanium implants were used to span large defects in the internal orbit to provide a platform for bone-graft support.\n Twenty-six implants were placed in immediate and 12 were placed in late orbital reconstructions.\n More reliable bone-graft position resulted.\n Two late infections have occurred resulting in implant removal in a 3-year period.",
