  "text": "Absence of estrogen receptors in dysplastic nevi and malignant melanoma.\n Benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, and primary and metastatic malignant melanomas were evaluated for the presence of sex hormone binding and estrogen receptor protein.\n We have confirmed the observation of Ellis et al.\n that some pigmented lesions possess sex hormone-binding proteins.\n We could not demonstrate a true estrogen receptor in any benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanomas, or metastatic melanomas.\n Thus the ability to bind estrogen or progesterone does not correlate with the presence of a true estrogen receptor.\n Lack of nuclear estrogen receptors suggests that the influence of estrogen on the pathophysiology of melanoma or of benign melanocytic nevi may not be significant.",
