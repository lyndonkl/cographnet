  "text": "Abnormal vitamin B6 status in childhood leukemia.\n Vitamin B6 is involved in many biological processes of potential relevance to carcinogenesis and tumor growth, including DNA synthesis and maintenance of immunocompetence, yet very little information exists on B6 nutritional status in childhood leukemia.\n Using a radioenzymatic assay, the authors measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of B6, in 11 newly diagnosed untreated children with leukemia and 11 age-matched controls.\n The children with leukemia had significantly lower PLP levels than the controls.\n In 26 additional leukemia patients and 26 additional controls, a high-performance liquid chromatography assay also demonstrated lower plasma PLP levels in childhood leukemia compared with controls.\n These differences were significant for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL).\n The PLP values did not correlate with indices of leukemia cell burden, but did correlate with reported B6 intake, suggesting that illness-related diet changes are at least partially responsible for the low PLP levels.\n Before any chemotherapy, overall nutritional status was suboptimal in 53% of ALL cases and 57% of ANLL cases.\n Newly diagnosed children with leukemia have suboptimal overall nutrition as well as suboptimal vitamin B6 status.",
