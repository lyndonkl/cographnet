  "text": "Surgical pocket reduction.\n It is not possible within the scope of this paper to describe in any detail each of the aforementioned procedures.\n These can be found in the various textbooks and journals on clinical periodontology.\n Instead, the objectives of treatment, the spectrum of techniques available, and the rationale for their use have been described.\n Periodontal surgery should be performed only under certain conditions: the patient must be physically and mentally competent to undergo any type of surgery, and should understand and agree to the procedure and to postoperative management.\n Finally, periodontal surgery should only be considered when nonsurgical therapy will not accomplish the desired result.\n When periodontal surgery for pocket elimination is performed for selected defects that have been properly evaluated after a debridement and healing period, and is executed with technical competence and proper postoperative care, it can preserve the dentition affected by periodontal disease.",
