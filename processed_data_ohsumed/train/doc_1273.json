  "text": "Infections in alcoholic patients.\n Alcoholic patients have an increased susceptibility to certain bacterial infections.\n Among the more important of these infections are pneumonia, tuberculosis, spontaneous peritonitis, and bacteremia.\n This susceptibility is caused by alteration of immune function and mechanical defenses and are the sequel of chronic alcoholism, most notably cirrhosis.\n In many infections, morbidity is increased in alcoholics, with the course of the illness being more severe and complications more frequent.\n Assessment of the alcoholic patient with suspected infection should, therefore, be thorough and treatment prompt.",
