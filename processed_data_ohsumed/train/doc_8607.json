  "text": "Treatment of digitalis intoxication with emphasis on the clinical use of digoxin immune Fab.\n Many studies and cases of digitalis intoxication have been reported since the time of William Withering's first publication in 1785.\n Recognition and management of digitalis toxicity is challenging.\n Before digoxin immune Fab was commercially available, treatment consisted of managing the signs and symptoms of toxicity until the digitalis was eliminated.\n Digoxin immune Fab offers a safe, effective, and specific method of quickly reversing digitalis toxicity.\n Factors that must be considered with the clinical use of this agent include the dosage calculation, administration technique, postdose monitoring, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, interference with commercially available digoxin assays, partial neutralizing dosing, rebound of free digoxin, and indications for use.\n For severe, life-threatening toxicity, digoxin immune Fab is the treatment of choice.",
