  "text": "Embolic stroke after smoking \"crack\" cocaine.\n A 39-year-old woman had an embolic upper division middle cerebral artery branch occlusion 3 hours after smoking the free base of cocaine (\"crack\").\n Radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated cardiomyopathy, and echocardiography documented a left atrial thrombus.\n This case demonstrates that embolism is one mechanism of ischemic stroke after cocaine use, and that cardiomyopathy, possibly cocaine induced, may be the source of embolus.\n A cardiac source of embolus should be sought in patients with cocaine-associated cerebral infarction.",
