  "text": "Induction of insulin resistance in vivo by amylin and calcitonin gene-related peptide.\n During hyperinsulinemic glucose-clamp studies, intravenous infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rats antagonized the ability of insulin to stimulate peripheral glucose disposal by 52% (196 +/- 7.2 vs.\n 105 +/- 10.5 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05) and to inhibit hepatic glucose output by 54% (P less than 0.01).\n CGRP also inhibited the in vitro effects of insulin to stimulate hexose uptake in cultured BC3H1 myocytes at all insulin concentrations studied.\n Amylin is a peptide isolated from amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects, is present in normal beta-cells, and bears a striking homology to CGRP.\n When synthetic human amylin was infused during clamp studies, it inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose disposal by 56% (96.9 +/- 9.4 vs.\n 42.4 +/- 5.0 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05) and to suppress hepatic glucose output by 64%.\n Therefore, amylin and CGRP can cause insulin resistance in vivo and may be implicated in insulin-resistant states such as type II diabetes mellitus.",
