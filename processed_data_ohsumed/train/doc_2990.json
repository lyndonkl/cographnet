  "text": "The role of tubal pathology and other parameters in ectopic pregnancies occurring in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.\n Contradictory findings were reported concerning the role of tubal disease in the genesis of ectopic pregnancy in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET).\n We report on six ectopics that occurred in 141 IVF-ET pregnancies (4.3%).\n All of the six cases were among 84 patients with tubal disease, and none occurred in the remaining 57 patients with other etiological factors.\n No correlation was found in other parameters including: ovulation induction, number of embryos transferred, and luteal support.\n A comparison between the ectopics and six matched controls demonstrated similar estradiol levels, but beta-hCG levels on day 15 to 17 after ET were lower.\n Homolateral salpingectomy was performed in all six cases, but a contralateral resection was carried out in three of them.\n More comprehensive studies are needed to clarify whether tubal pathology really increases the risk for ectopic gestation in IVF-ET.",
