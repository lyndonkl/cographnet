  "text": "A prospective assessment of the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble and bariatric surgery in the treatment of morbid obesity.\n Morbid obesity is a serious medical hazard, and effective alternatives to surgery have been unsuccessful.\n In 1985, the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble (GEGB) was offered as an adjunct to dietary and behavioral therapy for weight loss treatment.\n The safety and efficacy of the GEGB were compared with bariatric surgery, the current standard for the treatment of morbid obesity.\n Fifty-seven patients received GEGB and 77 underwent bariatric surgery.\n GEGB patients were divided into two groups: those who attended group therapy and those who did not.\n This study showed that bariatric surgery was far more effective in reducing excess body weight during a 12-month period compared with the GEGB plus group therapy and the GEGB alone.\n The morbidity from bariatric surgery was greater than in the GEGB-treated groups, while the cost for uncomplicated cases for a year's treatment was comparable.\n It is concluded that the GEGB does not offer an effective alternative to bariatric surgery in the treatment of morbid obesity.",
