  "text": "Reduction of contamination at total hip replacement by special working clothes.\n We assessed wound, air and operative field contamination at 50 total hip operations, performed in a zonal ventilation system.\n Theatre staff wore either a specially designed polypropylene non-woven coverall or conventional cotton shirt and trousers.\n The surgeons wore partially impermeable operating gowns.\n The polypropylene coverall was associated with significantly lower air and wound counts.\n The coverall was warmer than cotton but judged to be acceptable.\n The combined use of zonal ventilation and the coverall achieved ultra-clean air conditions.",
