  "text": "Cimetidine suppresses chemically induced experimental hepatic porphyria.\n The ability of cimetidine to reduce the activity of hepatic aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA-S) was examined in allylisopropyl acetamide (AIA) treated porphyric adult rats.\n A dose of 20 mg cimetidine/100 gm body weight resulted in a 50% decrease in the AIA-induced hepatic ALA-S activity compared to rats treated with AIA alone.\n Heme oxygenase activity was decreased 25% compared to rats treated with AIA alone.\n The effects of AIA and cimetidine on cytochrome P-450 were not additive, suggesting competition for a common site of interaction.\n The results suggest that cimetidine may prove to be useful in treating porphyria in humans.",
