  "text": "Epirubicin cardiotoxicity: a study of 135 patients with advanced breast cancer.\n The cardiotoxicity of epirubicin (EPI) was evaluated clinically, radiologically, with ECG, and with multiple ECG-gated radionuclide determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during rest in 135 patients with advanced breast cancer.\n The EPI doses were 60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or 45 mg/m2 plus vindesine 3 mg/m2 on the same schedule.\n The median cumulative dose of EPI was 500 mg/m2 (range, 47 to 1,563).\n Eight of the 135 patients developed congestive heart failure (CHF).\n Of 67 patients treated with EPI less than 500 mg/m2, none developed CHF.\n Among 48 patients treated with doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2, one had CHF (2%; 95% confidence limits, 0.1 to 11.1).\n Among 20 patients who received EPI from 1,000 to 1,563 mg/m2, seven developed CHF (35%; 95% confidence limits, 15.4 to 59.2).\n Four patients died due to cardiotoxicity.\n The risk of EPI cardiotoxicity at the present schedule is considerable at doses above 1,000 mg/m2.\n At doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2 the risk of CHF decreases, and at doses below 500 mg/m2, it is negligible.\n For all patients, the prevalence of CHF was 6% and the sensitivity of LVEF high (95%), mainly due to the low incidence of CHF.\n Among the 20 patients who received EPI at more than 1,000 mg/m2, the prevalence of CHF was 35% and the sensitivity only 64%.\n The specificity was maximally 62%.\n Our results suggest that LVEF is of no value as a predictor for CHF.",
