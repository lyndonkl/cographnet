  "text": "Plasmodium falciparum-infected Anopheles stephensi inconsistently transmit malaria to humans.\n Malaria was transmitted to only 5 of 10 volunteers bitten by 1-2 Anopheles stephensi carrying sporozoites of the 3D7 clone of the NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum in their salivary glands.\n Parasites were detectable by culture in blood taken 7-10 days following exposure and by thick blood film 14-16.5 days after exposure.\n Infectivity did not correlate with the numbers of sporozoites in the salivary glands.",
