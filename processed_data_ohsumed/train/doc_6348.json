  "text": "Primary malignant melanoma of the lower respiratory tract. Report of a case and literature review.\n The authors report a case of primary bronchial malignant melanoma, occurring in a 34-year-old woman presenting with persistent cough.\n At bronchoscopic examination, a polypoid mass was found to occlude the left mainstem bronchus.\n Biopsies showed a malignant epithelioid tumor resembling an atypical carcinoid.\n Histochemistry, electron microscopic study, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma.\n Physical examination and additional clinical history to exclude other possible primary sites were negative.\n The patient underwent thoracotomy with left pneumonectomy.\n Nineteen months after resection she was found to have a histologically similar tumor involving her left adrenal gland.\n Review of the literature shows that melanoma of the lower respiratory tract has been reported only in adults and has a tendency to present as a central polypoid growth that may be responsive to surgical resection.",
