  "text": "Techniques of adjustable suture strabismus surgery.\n Adjustable sutures allow eye muscle positions to be changed following strabismus surgery, when the patient is awake and able to cooperate in muscle balance testing.\n Bow-tie-knot and sliding-handle sutures can be adjusted within 24 hours after surgery.\n Scleral traction sutures, which can be used to fix the globe to periorbital tissues during postoperative healing, can be adjusted for up to 14 days after surgery.\n We describe these techniques as well as an adjustable loop suture for conjunctival closure.",
