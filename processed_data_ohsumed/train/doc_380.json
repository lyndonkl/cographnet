  "text": "Hemoptysis in a 49-year-old man. An unusual presentation of a sporadic disease.\n Although amebiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, it occurs sporadically in the United States.\n Pleuropulmonary involvement is seen in about 20 percent of the patients with amebic liver abscesses.\n We describe a patient with pleuropulmonary amebiasis who complained of hemoptysis but had no gastrointestinal symptoms.\n This rather unusual presentation caused a considerable delay in securing the diagnosis.",
