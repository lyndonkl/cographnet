  "text": "Avoiding a wrapped endotracheal tube in laser laryngeal surgery: experiences with apneic anesthesia and metal laser-flex endotracheal tubes.\n Ninety-one laser laryngeal procedures using the apneic technique of anesthesia were performed in 28 patients between 2 months and 64 years of age.\n Seventy-two procedures (79%) were performed on children and 19 on adults.\n There were no complications.\n Eight laser laryngoscopies were performed using a new metal Laser-Flex endotracheal tube.\n Obstruction of the endotracheal tube with a mucous plug occurred in one case.\n The apneic technique described in this paper provides a laser operative field free of an endotracheal tube, virtually eliminating the danger of a laser fire.\n It is a relatively safe and effective means of performing laser laryngeal surgery.\n In addition, the Laser-Flex endotracheal tube appears to be an acceptable alternative to a metallic tape-wrapped endotracheal tube.",
