  "text": "Sarcoidosis complicated by HIV infection: three case reports and a review of the literature.\n We report three cases of sarcoidosis complicated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and review four other isolated case reports in the literature.\n There is clinical overlap of both diseases, including symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities, and lymphocyte function.\n Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in these patients showed a lymphocytic alveolitis without pathogens.\n BAL lymphocyte subset analysis showed markedly depressed CD4+/CD8+ ratios in three patients.\n These data were clinically useful for distinguishing the CD8+ alveolitis associated with HIV infection from the CD4+ alveolitis associated with sarcoidosis.\n Three patients improved with corticosteroid therapy.\n Two patients with BAL-documented CD8+ alveolitis tolerated discontinuation of steroids.\n One patient's sarcoidosis improved without therapy concurrent with the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.\n Another patient developed sarcoidosis 1 yr after manifesting HIV positive serology.\n BAL can be used to distinguish the lymphocytic alveolitis of sarcoidosis from that associated with HIV infection.\n Patients with active sarcoidosis complicated by HIV infection can be effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy.",
