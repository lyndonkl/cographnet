  "text": "Effects of lovastatin in diabetic patients treated with chlorpropamide.\n Patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than nondiabetic subjects.\n In seven patients with both hypercholesterolemia and NIDDM controlled by chlorpropamide, lovastatin (20 mg b.i.d.\n for 6 weeks) lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 28%, total cholesterol by 24%, and apolipoprotein B by 24%.\n Lovastatin levels for a 4-hour period (measured as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitory activity) were similar to those measured previously in nondiabetic patients.\n Lovastatin did not alter chlorpropamide kinetics or glycemic profiles.\n No patient had an elevation in serum transaminases or creatinine phosphokinase, and no patient had any other laboratory or clinical drug-related adverse experience during the study.\n Lovastatin was as effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with NIDDM as in nondiabetic subjects.\n Diabetic control was unaltered, and no evidence of alteration in lovastatin or chlorpropamide blood levels was noted.",
