A case of suspected micturition syncope.\n A case of postanaesthesia micturition syncope with respiratory arrest is described.\n If syncope occurs, the temporary myocardial ischaemia and cerebral hypoperfusion may increase anaesthetic risk in the marginally compensated patient.\n The loss of airway protection during the syncopal period is also a cause of concern.\n We recommend the use of an indwelling bladder catheter during any prolonged surgical procedure.",
