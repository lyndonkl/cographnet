  "text": "Simplified two-stage below-knee amputation for unsalvageable diabetic foot infections.\n A simplified two-stage below-knee amputation for unsalvageable diabetic foot infections was done on 19 limbs with 84% good results for healing.\n The first stage was the standard below-knee amputation with a long posterior flap in which the fascia and skin were closed in the central portion with the medial and lateral portions of the wound left open for drainage.\n The second stage was delayed until closure of the open wounds three to seven days after the first stage.\n Wagner's classification of diabetic foot lesions was used to stratify these cases.\n Grades 3 and 4 foot infections had a uniformly good prognosis for healing with this surgical technique.\n Grade 5 foot infections had a poor prognosis for healing, especially if associated with renal failure and dialysis, even with an initial guillotine amputation.",
