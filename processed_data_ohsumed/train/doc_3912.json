  "text": "Continuous epidural hydromorphone for postthoracotomy pain relief \n Forty-four patients were treated with a continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone (0.05%) after thoracic operations.\n Postoperatively, visual analog pain scores were obtained.\n On postoperative day 1 and 2, more than 90% of the patients experienced either no pain (visual analog pain scale = 0) or mild pain (visual analog pain score = 1 to 3) at rest.\n The incidence of side effects (hypoventilation, pruritis, and nausea) was less than reported with other epidurally administered opioids.\n Continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone produced safe, predictable analgesia after thoracotomy.",
