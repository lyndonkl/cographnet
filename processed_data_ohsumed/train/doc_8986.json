  "text": "Underexpression of beta cell high Km glucose transporters in noninsulin-dependent diabetes [published erratum appears in Science 1990 Nov 30;250(4985):1195]\n The role of defective glucose transport in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) was examined in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of NIDDM.\n As in human NIDDM, insulin secretion was unresponsive to 20 mM glucose.\n Uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by islet cells was less than 19% of controls.\n The beta cell glucose transporter (GLUT-2) immunoreactivity and amount of GLUT-2 messenger RNA were profoundly reduced.\n Whenever fewer than 60% of beta cells were GLUT-2-positive, the response to glucose was absent and hyperglycemia exceeded 11 mM plasma glucose.\n We conclude that in NIDDM underexpression of GLUT-2 messenger RNA lowers high Km glucose transport in beta cells, and thereby impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and prevents correction of hyperglycemia.",
