  "text": "Effects of 2% lignocaine on somatosensory evoked potentials recorded in the extradural space.\n We have studied the effects of extradural administration of 2% lignocaine at the L3-4 interspace on somatosensory evoked potentials recorded in the cervical extradural space before corrective surgery for idiopathic adolescent scoliosis.\n Eight patients in whom the equivalent volume of 0.9% sodium chloride solution was administered into the lumbar extradural space acted as a control group.\n Lignocaine 2% resulted in a decrease in overall amplitude, but its main effect was a significant decrease in the amplitude of the second and third peaks, suggesting an action on the dorsal columns of the spinal cord.\n A significant increase in latency was found in both the lignocaine and sodium chloride groups.\n We conclude that the use of extradural 2% lignocaine in patients undergoing scoliosis surgery may interfere with the intraoperative monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials.",
