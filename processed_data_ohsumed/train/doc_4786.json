  "text": "Combined laryngeal framework medialization and reinnervation for unilateral vocal fold paralysis.\n The laryngeal framework-Silastic implant technique has become an increasingly attractive alternative to Teflon injection, particularly when there is fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint or the defect to be corrected is larger than usual; but it does not restore ability to change tension in the vocal fold.\n Unilateral vocal fold reinnervation can overcome this drawback and, when used in conjunction with surgical medialization, may offer return of function very close to normal.\n Twenty-nine patients with unrecovered unilateral vocal fold paralysis and/or fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint have been managed by use of a Silastic implant combined with unilateral vocal fold reinnervation with no complications.\n Voice improvement has been assessed on preoperative and postoperative voice recordings.\n The combined surgical techniques for reinnervation and a modification of Silastic implantation via the laryngeal framework approach are reported.",
