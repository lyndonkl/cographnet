  "text": "Ultrasonic forms of posterior staphyloma.\n The most frequent deformations of the globe encountered in pediatric ophthalmology are staphylomas and colobomas.\n In this paper we reviewed 16 ultrasonographically diagnosed staphylomas and classified the ultrasonographic patterns produced by staphyloma cases into four types: (1) staphylomas involving the posterior pole but not the optic nerve head, (2) staphylomas involving the posterior pole and the optic nerve head, (3) peripapillary staphylomas, and (4) giant peripapillary staphylomas.\n Morphologic and ultrasonographic characteristics are described.",
