  "text": "Verbal memory impairment correlates with hippocampal pyramidal cell density.\n Thirty-five patients with medically refractory epilepsy localized to the temporal lobe (18 left, 17 right) completed the verbal Selective Reminding Test before surgery.\n Verbal memory impairments existed before surgery regardless of the lateralization of the seizure focus, but patients with left temporal seizure foci were significantly more impaired.\n After surgical removal of the mesial temporal lobe structures, 2 blinded observers established volumetric cell densities for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, the hilar area, and the granule cell layer of the area dentata.\n Statistically significant correlations existed between presurgical memory impairment and cell counts (in CA3 and the hilar area, only) for patients with left temporal seizure foci.\n These findings support the hippocampal model of memory and complement prior research documenting the memory impairments present after surgical removal of the mesial temporal structures.",
