  "text": "Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas in a patient with hepatitis A.\n Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas were found in a 30-year-old patient with serologically confirmed hepatitis A.\n Other causes associated with the presence of fibrin-ring granulomas in the liver, such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus infection, visceral leishmaniasis, and consumption of allopurinol, were ruled out.\n It is suggested that hepatitis A must be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas.",
