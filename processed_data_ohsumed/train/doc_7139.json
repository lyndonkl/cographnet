  "text": "Efficacy of radical neck dissection for the control of cervical metastasis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\n Fifty-one patients who had persistent or recurrent neck disease from nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy underwent radical neck dissection.\n The follow-up period ranged from 0.5 to 9 years (median: 2 years).\n Multiple cervical lymph node involvement was present in 51% of the patients (26 of 51).\n Malignant cells were detected in 88% of the resected specimens (45 of 51).\n The clinical sign of fixation of lymph node is the only factor that affects the successful control of neck disease (p = 0.04).\n Extracapsular extension of the nodal disease was present, and 35% of the lymph nodes were adherent to surrounding structures at operation (18 of 51).\n There was one hospital mortality and the overall morbidity was minimal.\n The actuarial survival at 5 years was 38%, and the probability of control of neck disease was 66%.\n Radical neck dissection is effective in controlling post-irradiation cervical metastasis from nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
