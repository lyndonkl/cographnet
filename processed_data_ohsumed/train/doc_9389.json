  "text": "Lack of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase in fibroblasts from a child with urinary excretion of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-bile acids. A new inborn error of metabolism.\n Cultured fibroblasts were shown to be capable of catalyzing the conversion of 7 alpha-hydroxy-cholesterol to 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, an important reaction in bile acid synthesis.\n The apparent Km was approximately 7 mumol/liter and Vmax varied between 3 and 9 nmol/mg protein per h under the assay conditions used.\n The assay was used to investigate fibroblasts from a patient who presented with a familial giant cell hepatitis and who was found to excrete the monosulfates of 3 beta, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid and 3 beta, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid in urine (Clayton, P.\n T., J.\n V.\n Leonard, A.\n M.\n Lawson, K.\n D.\n R.\n Setchell, S.\n Andersson, B.\n Egestad, and J.\n Sjovall.\n 1987.\n J.\n Clin.\n Invest.\n 79:1031-1038).\n In addition 7 alpha-hydroxy-cholesterol was found to accumulate in the circulation.\n Cultured fibroblasts from this boy were completely devoid of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase activity.\n Fibroblasts from his parents had reduced activity, compatible with a heterozygous genotype.\n The results provide strong evidence for the suggestion that this patient's liver disease was caused by a primary defect in the 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase involved in bile acid biosynthesis.",
