  "text": "Pharmacologic irreversible narrowing in chronic cerebrovasospasm in rabbits is associated with functional damage.\n We studied isolated basilar artery segments from a rabbit model of chronic cerebrovasospasm.\n Autologous blood placed around the basilar artery of rabbits killed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 days later caused narrowing of the segments with a biphasic time course.\n The first (immediate) phase was reversed by intra-arterial papaverine; the second phase exhibited an increasing component of narrowing that was papaverine-insensitive.\n Based on the passive force/length curves, basilar artery segments became increasingly stiff over 9 days.\n By contrast, the segments' contractility decreased.\n Responses of the basilar artery segments were greater over the first few days, but then became less than that of saline-injected controls.\n Contractions in response to norepinephrine and potassium were reduced.\n Endothelium-based acetylcholine-induced vasodilation progressively diminished, as did the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation.\n There was a negative correlation between artery wall stiffness and contractility.\n The papaverine-insensitive component of angiographic narrowing correlated directly with loss of contractility and with artery wall stiffness.\n These results are consistent with the conclusion that increased artery wall stiffness is a primary determining factor in the arterial narrowing of chronic cerebrovasospasm.",
