  "text": "Intraabdominal hemorrhage as a result of segmental mediolytic arteritis of an omental artery: case report.\n This article describes the fifth reported case of segmental mediolytic arteritis and the second in a survivor.\n The patient had intraabdominal bleeding as a result of a ruptured omental artery.\n The pathologic and arteriographic findings are described.\n The pathology is characterized by segmental disruption of the medial smooth muscle cells and the initiation of mediolysis.\n Mediolysis is associated with marked segmental thinning of the vessel wall, often with only the adventitia intact.\n Fibrin is deposited at the adventitial and medial surfaces, and hemorrhage into the media may occur.\n As in this reported case, lysis of the adventitia leads to sudden, often catastrophic intraabdominal hemorrhage.\n Little associated adventitial inflammation occurred.\n Segmental mediolytic arteritis seems to involve the intra-abdominal muscular arteries in elderly patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms.\n An angiogram showed patchy areas of narrowing involving ileal, gastroduodenal, and renal arteries that correlated with the pathologic findings observed in the excised omental arteries.",
