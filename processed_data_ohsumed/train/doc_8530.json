  "text": "Stress in surgeons.\n A sample of 1000 members of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland was circulated with a postal questionnaire relating to their occupational stressors, their type A coronary-prone behaviour and their mental health.\n Six hundred and seventy-two (67 per cent) useable forms were returned anonymously.\n The major individual stressors were: (1) the interference of the job with personal life, (2) general administration, and (3) the number of patients in clinics.\n Type A behaviour was similar to that of other professional groups.\n Surgeons showed mean scores significantly higher than the general population on two subscales of the mental health index (free-floating anxiety and hysterical anxiety).\n The findings for the few female surgeons (2 per cent) were similar to those in men but they did not exhibit raised free-floating anxiety levels.",
