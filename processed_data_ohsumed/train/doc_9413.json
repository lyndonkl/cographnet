  "text": "Insulinomimetic properties of trace elements and characterization of their in vivo mode of action.\n Lithium and vanadate have insulinomimetic actions in vitro.\n In this study, we examined the in vivo effects of lithium and vanadate on glucose metabolism in diabetic (90% partial pancreatectomy) rats.\n Four groups of chronically catheterized rats were studied: control, diabetic, diabetic treated with lithium (plasma concn 1.0 +/- 0.1 meq/L) and vanadate (0.05 mg/ml in drinking water), and diabetic treated with lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium.\n Postmeal plasma glucose was increased in diabetic versus control rats (18.7 vs.\n 7.7 mM, P less than 0.01) and was normalized by addition of lithium and vanadate (8 mM) or lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium (7.4 mM).\n Euglycemic insulin-clamp studies were performed 2 wk posttreatment; insulin-mediated glucose uptake was reduced in diabetic compared with control rats (142 +/- 4 vs.\n 200 +/- 5 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01), returned to normal with lithium and vanadate (206 +/- 6 mumol.kg-1.min-1), or increased to supranormal levels with lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium (238 +/- 6 mumol.kg-1.min-1).\n During the insulin clamp, muscle glycogenic rate was severely impaired in diabetic versus control rats (18 vs.\n 70 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and was normalized by lithium and vanadate (91 mumol.kg-1.min-1) or lithium, vanadate, zinc, and magnesium (93 mumol.kg-1.min-1).",
