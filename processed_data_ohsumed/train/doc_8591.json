  "text": "The osteogenic response to distant skeletal injury.\n We tested the hypothesis that when one bone of the skeleton is injured, others experience an osteogenic response.\n Although similar or related phenomena have been observed previously, the purposes of the study were to determine if this response was reproducible, to characterize it in terms of its magnitude and duration, and to show how it is related to the type of injury sustained.\n To obtain this information, a model was used in which an intramedullary nail was implanted in the femur and a standard closed fracture was subsequently produced.\n The osteogenic response was measured by histomorphometry.\n Eight-four nine-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven groups of twelve animals each.\n Groups I and II consisted of control animals in which no injury was produced.\n In Group-III rats, cortical drilling of the intercondylar notch and piriformis fossa of the right femur was performed, without intramedullary nailing.\n In Groups IV through VII, half of each group received intramedullary nails only, and in the other half intramedullary nailing was done and a closed transverse diaphyseal fracture was produced.\n With two different fluorochrome labels, rates of mineral apposition were measured in the left and right tibiae of all animals.\n The labeling periods differed in each group and were designed to determine when the peak response occurred, how long it lasted, and whether aging during the course of the experiment affected the response.",
