  "text": "Individualizing treatment of vaginal candidiasis.\n Clinicians have a vast array of effective antimycotics for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.\n Multiple topical formulations are available, yet there is little evidence to suggest that formulation per se influences outcome.\n A growing number of highly effective oral systemic antimycotic agents provide the practitioner with additional options.\n Treatment regimens have also changed with the introduction of shorter, often single-day/single-dose courses of therapy.\n Not all therapeutic agents have the same activity against vaginal fungal pathogens in that topical azoles tend to be more active than nystatin.\n Differences in patient characteristics, however, are more important than the differences between antimycotic agents and therapeutic regimens in determining selection of the appropriate antimycotic.\n Patients with vaginal candidiasis vary with regard to duration and severity of symptoms and past frequency of attacks, distribution of inflammation, and pregnancy status.\n The clinician should consider all these variables both in selecting the appropriate antimycotic agent and the route of administration and in planning the duration of therapy.\n Individualized therapy offers additional benefits to patients, who may then enjoy the maximum advantages of antimycotics now available.",
