  "text": "Biliary and gut function following shock.\n The aim of this study was to characterize the alterations in gallbladder and intestinal function after hemorrhagic shock and blood reperfusion in opossums.\n Animals were subjected to a shock of 30 mm Hg of arterial blood pressure for 60 minutes and resuscitated with blood reinfusion.\n Gallbladder epithelial ion transport, gallbladder motility in vitro and in vivo, gastrointestinal motility, and flora of the stomach and small bowel were studied 2 and 24 hours after shock.\n Changes at 2 hours included decreased gallbladder contractility in vitro and decreased emptying in vivo, loss of coordination with intestinal motor activity, decrease in frequency of intestinal electrical slow waves, and reduced duration of the intestinal migrating motor complex cycle.\n By 24 hours, gallbladder epithelial permeability was increased and in vitro contractility remained reduced but the in vivo functions showed partial recovery.\n Gastrointestinal flora was not affected by these changes.\n These data demonstrate that hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion affect digestive motility.\n The early timing of the alterations observed and the partial recovery 24 hours post shock suggest an ischemia-hypoxia mechanism of injury.",
