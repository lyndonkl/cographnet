  "text": "Dementia: what to do.\n Dementia is a syndrome of acquired intellectual deterioration that interferes with personal or social functioning.\n Diagnosis requires historical information from the family and the mental status evaluation of orientation, recent memory, comprehension, calculation, and abstraction.\n Most dementias create permanent, even progressive cognitive deterioration, yet there are some presentations for which remission exists.\n Common reversible conditions include depression, drug toxicity, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, subdural hematoma, and neoplasm.\n Screening laboratory studies consist of urinalysis, chemistry profile, blood count, thyroid survey, vitamin B12 and folate measurements, serology, chest roentgenogram, computerized tomographic scan of the head, electroencephalogram, and electrocardiogram.\n Treatment focuses on potential reversibility, psychosocial issues, restoring deficits, and specific symptoms.",
