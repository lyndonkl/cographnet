  "text": "Disseminated histoplasmosis with embolic endovascular complications: a case report.\n A 57-year-old man had subacute embolic ischemia of his right foot and subsequent acute embolic ischemia of his left foot after angiography.\n Thrombus removed at the time of the left femoral thromboembolectomy grew Histoplasma capsulatum confirming the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.\n Surgical revascularization of the right leg and parenteral amphotericin B was followed by chronic ketoconazole therapy for 16 months.\n The patient has remained asymptomatic at 30 months after operation.\n Effective treatment of endovascular infection with ischemic complications of Histoplasmosis requires surgical revascularization and intensive chemotherapeutic intervention.\n Histoplasmosis is a ubiquitous infection in endemic areas that often has an asymptomatic subclinical course.\n Involvement of the cardiovascular system is rarely reported.\n Previous case reports have described infected cardiac valves and aortic aneurysms.\n This report describes the uncommon presentation of disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection as a peripheral embolic event and the successful management with revascularization combined with systemic amphotericin B followed by ketoconazole therapy.",
