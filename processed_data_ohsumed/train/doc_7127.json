  "text": "Ultrasonographic assessment of placental abnormalities.\n Current ultrasonographic techniques offer a novel approach for the identification of a wide variety of placental abnormalities usually described postnatally by the pathologist.\n Placental vascular lesions, placental tumors, and abnormal placentation are potentially associated with perinatal complications and their diagnosis in utero may influence the pregnancy management.\n An ultrasonographic classification of placental lesions that is based on their location, size, echogenicity, and number is proposed.\n Repeated ultrasonographic examination, together with biologic investigations, is important for the prenatal differential diagnosis of most these lesions and for full understanding of their pathophysiologic characteristics and significance.",
