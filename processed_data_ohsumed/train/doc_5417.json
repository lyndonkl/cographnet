  "text": "Low-dose heparinization can be used with DEAE-cellulose hemodialysis membranes.\n The ability of DEAE-cellulose (Hemophan) membranes to bind heparin may reduce bioavailable heparin and predispose to dialyzer clotting, thus preventing use of Hemophan with low-dose heparin.\n To examine this possibility, residual blood volumes were determined following 95 treatments with dialyzers containing Hemophan membranes in 11 patients.\n No heparin was added to the saline used to prime the dialyzers.\n The anticoagulant effect of heparin was measured using recalcified activated clotting times (RACT).\n Two heparin doses, calculated by a pharmacokinetic model to increase baseline RACT by 12.5% and 25%, were used for each patient.\n The mean heparin loading doses were 10.2 +/- 2.8 and 15.3 +/- 2.2 IU/kg, respectively, and the mean infusion rates were 11.1 +/- 3.2 and 14.7 +/- 3.2 IU/kg/h, respectively.\n Residual blood volumes were determined by red cell lysis and hemoglobinometry.\n In 88 treatments, residual blood volume averaged 1.6 +/- 1.5 ml.\n In the other seven treatments, residual blood volume greater than 10 ml was seen.\n In five of these cases, clotting appeared to propagate from the arterial drip chamber.\n Residual blood volume did not correlate with the level of heparin.\n The data show that low-dose heparin can be used with Hemophan membranes, and suggest that blood tubing design may be an important factor in blood circuit clotting during hemodialysis.",
