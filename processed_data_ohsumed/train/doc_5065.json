  "text": "Tuberculous psoas muscle abscess following chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n A 34-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and disseminated Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare infection developed a right psoas muscle abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n The abscess occurred 18 months after completion of a 12-month course of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid that was given because of a positive reaction with purified protein derivative of tuberculin.\n The adjacent vertebrae did not appear to be involved.\n The abscess was drained with a percutaneously inserted catheter, and he received standard antituberculous chemotherapy.\n Three weeks into therapy, a second drainage with a catheter was required.\n The isolation of two mycobacteria in this patient and the apparent failure of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid are noted.",
