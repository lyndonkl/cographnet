  "text": "Cirrhosis of the liver. A risk factor for development of cholelithiasis in males.\n An ultrasonographic study about the prevalence of cholelithiasis was performed in 410 cirrhotic patients and in 414 controls matched for age and sex.\n Gallstone disease was found more often in cirrhotic patients (31.9%) than in controls (20.7%) (P less than 0.001).\n The female-to-male ratio of gallstones prevalence in cirrhotic patients approached to 1:1.\n Gallstone disease in cirrhotic patients vs controls was significantly higher (30.2% vs 16.5%) (P less than 0.001) in males only.\n No difference was found, for gallstone disease prevalence in cirrhosis of different etiology.\n The prevalence of cholelithiasis increased from Child's A to Child's C with a significant trend (P less than 0.001); this difference was significant in males (12.3% vs 40.5%) (P less than 0.001) but not in females.\n This study shows that cirrhosis represents a risk factor for the development of cholelithiasis in males.\n We suggest that high levels of estrogens could play a role in these patients, by an impairment of gallbladder emptying similar to that observed in pregnant women.",
