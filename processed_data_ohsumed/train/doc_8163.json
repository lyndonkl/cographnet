  "text": "Surgical management of palmar hyperhidrosis.\n Hyperhidrosis is an idiopathic pathologic condition characterized by excessive sweating beyond that required to cool the body.\n Disturbance of the central nervous system, endocrine system, or obesity has been associated with this condition.\n Patients have a history of several years of occupational or social embarrassment.\n Individuals of Japanese ancestry and Jews of Northern African, Yemeni, or Balkan descent are predisposed to the condition.\n Nonoperative therapy is merely temporizing and unacceptable because of lack of efficacy or side effects.\n Surgical intervention provides effective and permanent control.\n The key to surgical correction appears to be the division of the sympathetic chain above the T-2 ganglion and below the T-3 ganglion of the involved side with removal of the entire T2-3 segment with its corresponding spinal nerves.\n This paper presents our experience with the dorsal thoracic approach for interruption of sympathetic innervation for severe palmar hyperhidrosis.\n We also review surgical efficacy of various approaches to the sympathetic chain, as well as possible side effects of operative intervention.",
