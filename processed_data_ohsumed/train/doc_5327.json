  "text": "Intravesical condyloma acuminatum with progression to verrucous carcinoma.\n Condyloma acuminatum is a common form of venereal disease.\n Most patients with condylomata acuminata suffer from only the local cosmetic and irritative effects of the lesions.\n Few patients have progression to aggressive, regionally distributed lesions that can be life-threatening.\n We describe a forty-three-year-old white woman who had a seventeen-year history of scleroderma with extravesical and intravesical condylomata acuminata.\n During two years of conservative management with transurethral excision, electrocoagulation, and intravesical chemotherapy, the disease progressed to involve the entire bladder and resulted in obstructive renal insufficiency that required anterior exenteration and urinary diversion.\n The natural history of the disease is described, and the relevant literature is reviewed.",
