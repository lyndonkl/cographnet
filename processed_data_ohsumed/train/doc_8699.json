  "text": "Continuous suprascapular nerve block for analgesia of scapular fracture.\n Fracture of the scapular is uncommon but painful.\n A case is described in which a comminuted scapular fracture was treated with a continuous suprascapular nerve block.\n With the patient lying supine an epidural needle was directed towards the scapular notch via a superior approach and an epidural catheter was placed when the notch was believed to have been identified.\n Repeat injections of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25 per cent with 1/200,000 epinephrine provided analgesia within minutes and a duration of 8-10 hr.\n Injection of 10 ml radio-opaque dye demonstrated the catheter to be lateral to the scapular notch.\n However, dye dispersed throughout the supraspinous fossa including the scapular notch thus blocking the suprascapular nerve.\n This case demonstrates that continuous suprascapular nerve block can be performed for five days and that location of the scapular notch is less important than previously thought.",
