  "text": "Pneumothorax following cytotoxic chemotherapy in malignant lymphoma.\n Pneumothorax occurring as a complication of the antitumor effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy has been reported in occasional cases of a variety of tumors.\n Its occurrence in malignant lymphoma has not been reported heretofore.\n In this report, we describe two cases of this complication in patients with malignant lymphoma and discuss the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms involved.\n Because pulmonary involvement with the tumor was found in both cases, pneumothorax could be attributed to the anti-tumor effect of cytotoxic agents on underlying lung involvement in patients with malignant lymphoma.",
