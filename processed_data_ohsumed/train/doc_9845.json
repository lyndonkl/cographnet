  "text": "Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in multiple sclerosis.\n Regional in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides quantitative data on selected chemical constituents of brain.\n We imaged 16 volunteers with clinically definite multiple sclerosis on a 1.5 tesla magnetic resonance scanner to define plaque-containing volumes of interest, and obtained localized water-suppressed proton spectra using a stimulated echo sequence.\n Twenty-five of 40 plaque-containing regions provided spectra of adequate quality.\n Of these, 8 spectra from 6 subjects were consistent with the presence of cholesterol or fatty acids; the remainder were similar to those obtained from white matter of normal volunteers.\n This early experience with regional proton spectroscopy suggests that individual plaques are distinct.\n These differences likely reflect dynamic stages of the evolution of the demyelinative process not previously accessible to in vivo investigation.",
