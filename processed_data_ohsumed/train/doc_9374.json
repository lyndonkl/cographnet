  "text": "Development of IDDM after donating kidney to diabetic sibling.\n The goal of this study was to describe a patient who developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) after donating a kidney to his sibling and to suggest a possible solution to prevent such an occurrence.\n A 42-yr-old man was found to have islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) as part of a screening program of first-degree relatives with IDDM.\n Two years previously, he had donated his kidney to his HLA-identical sibling with long-standing IDDM.\n Both oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests demonstrated a gradual loss of insulin secretion and increasing glucose intolerance until the patient developed IDDM 6 yr after the nephrectomy.\n Whether the presence of ICA is an absolute contraindication to being a kidney donor could be debated.\n Nonetheless, ICA should be used as a screening test to identify individuals at risk for subsequent IDDM.\n For those found to be positive, counseling should be provided.",
