  "text": "Granular cell tumor of the esophagus: endoscopic ultrasonographic demonstration and endoscopic removal.\n A 35-yr-old Japanese man with a granular cell tumor of the esophagus that was removed by endoscopic polypectomy is presented.\n Radiography and endoscopy showed a 20 x 12 mm sessile protrusion in the distal esophagus.\n Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated the hypoechoic mass in the submucosa without continuity to the muscularis propria.\n The lesion was successfully treated by endoscopic polypectomy without complications.\n The cross-sections of the resected specimen were quite in agreement with the ultrasonographic findings.\n Endoscopic ultrasonography is valuable to assess the exact location and extent of the tumor, and to determine the indication for endoscopic polypectomy.",
