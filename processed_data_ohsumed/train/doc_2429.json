  "text": "Trochanteric fractures. Mobility, complications, and mortality in 607 cases treated with the sliding-screw technique.\n Six hundred seven trochanteric fractures (563 patients) were treated with a sliding-screw technique and followed clinically and roentgenographically for at least one year.\n Of 351 patients admitted from their homes, 209 (60%) were discharged to their homes after an average of 18 days in the hospital.\n During the first year another 61 (17%) patients returned home after rehabilitation in a geriatric ward.\n Of 446 patients walking without support or with one cane before surgery, 360 (80%) had regained the same mobility after one year.\n The one-year mortality rate was 18%, while the ten-year rate was 74%.\n Compared with a control cohort, the mortality rate was increased during the first two years after fracture.\n The increase in mortality was influenced by advanced age, admission from long-term care institutions, male gender, and ambulatory or nonambulatory status before surgery.\n Forty-five (7.4%) were reoperated, 17 because of technical complications, three because of infection, and three because of nonunion.\n No further nonunions occurred.\n The deep infection rate was nine of 339 (2.7%) before and two of 268 (0.8%) after the introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis.\n Thromboembolic complications decreased from 4.1% to 1.2% after the introduction of dextran 70 as thromboembolic prophylaxis.",
