  "text": "Cardiovascular effects of nicardipine.\n Nicardipine, a new 1-4 dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has chemical properties that allow oral and stable intravenous preparations.\n It is the first intravenous dihydropyridine calcium antagonist available in the United States.\n Among its drug class it has a unique chemical structure that affords properties useful in the treatment of acute cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and other related disorders.\n In patients with coronary artery disease, intravenous nicardipine has been found to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing afterload and increasing myocardial oxygen supply through coronary vasodilatation.\n It enhances left ventricular performance and augments coronary blood flow beyond that required by increased myocardial oxygen consumption.\n Nicardipine may also offer protection from ischemic injury to the heart and central nervous system.\n Alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, nicardipine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.\n It is safe for use in patients with certain types of conduction disturbances because it does not greatly affect sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction.\n Additional advantages for nicardipine's use in the management of acute cardiovascular disorders are its rapid onset and short duration of action.",
