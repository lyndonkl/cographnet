  "text": "Chronic arterial occlusion with PGE1-resistant skin lesions treated by glycosaminoglycan compound--case reports.\n The authors report on 2 patients with chronic arterial occlusion in whom the intravenous administration of the glycosaminoglycan compound FPFD 101 was markedly effective.\n One patient suffered from thromboembolic episodes of the left hand, and the other had peripheral circulatory impairment related to collagen disease.\n In these patients, the oral administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in combination with intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 was not adequately effective.\n However, the addition of intravenous injection of FPFD 101 resulted in a marked improvement in their symptoms.\n FPFD 101, which has an anticoagulant effect and also inhibits platelet aggregation, seems to be useful for the treatment and prevention of chronic arterial occlusion when combined with drugs such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and vasodilators.",
