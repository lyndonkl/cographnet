  "text": "Pulmonary resection combined with cardiac operations.\n Surgical management of patients with concomitant critical cardiac disease and resectable lung lesions is controversial.\n During a 7-year period (1982 to 1988), 21 patients underwent combined cardiac and pulmonary operations.\n Patients had cardiac symptoms only; the lung lesions were found on preoperative chest roentgenograms.\n The pathological diagnosis was established in only 2 of the patients before operation.\n All underwent concurrent pulmonary resection during cardiac operations requiring extracorporeal circulation.\n The pulmonary operations included 17 wedge resections and four lobectomies.\n The final diagnoses in 8 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer included epidermoid carcinoma (4), adenocarcinoma (3), and bronchoalveolar carcinoma (1).\n Postoperatively, 1 patient required a permanent pacemaker and 1 patient died.\n The actuarial survival at 5 years for all patients who underwent combined procedures was 95%.\n The 5-year survival for the 8 patients with lung cancer was 88% compared with 100% for those with benign pulmonary pathology (p = 0.172).\n This experience suggests that combining pulmonary resection with cardiac operations is safe and offers a favorable prognosis to a select group of patients.",
