  "text": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia: impact of hemorrhagic complications on response to induction chemotherapy and survival.\n From 1976 to 1989, 21 adult patients with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia were seen at the University of Virginia Hospital.\n We reviewed their cases retrospectively to determine the impact of hemorrhagic complications and other factors on treatment outcome.\n We observed a complete remission rate of 35%; the median survival in complete responders was 15 months.\n Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in 13 (62%) of the 21 cases at diagnosis.\n Fatal intracranial hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, occurring in eight (40%) of the 20 patients evaluated.\n Initial leukocyte count greater than 4.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet count less than 20 x 10(9)/L were significantly associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\n In patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by treatment with heparin.\n The high mortality of 40% (8/20) due to intracranial hemorrhage during induction was a major contributor to the low complete remission rate of 35% (7/20) in this series of consecutive unselected patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia.",
