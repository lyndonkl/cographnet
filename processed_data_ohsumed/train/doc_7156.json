  "text": "Bronchogenic carcinoma in situ on the carina eradicated by endobronchial biopsy.\n Squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the bronchus is a rare disorder in an isolated clinical setting.\n We present a case of carcinoma in situ located on the carina with excisional biopsy via a fiberoptic bronchoscope and no recurrence after five years.\n To our knowledge, this represents the only case of carcinoma in situ treated solely with excisional biopsy.\n This case further emphasizes the importance of securing biopsy specimens for all mucosal abnormalities and raises the possibility of limited excision as sole therapy for carcinoma in situ.",
