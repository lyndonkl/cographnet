  "text": "Ultrasound-guided transcervical metroplasty.\n A new technique of metroplasty is described.\n The septum is divided with 4-mm endoscopic scissors introduced into the uterine cavity through the cervix.\n The whole procedure is monitored by a real-time ultrasound scanner.\n Twenty-four patients were operated on with this technique.\n No complication was encountered.\n Fifteen patients had third trimester deliveries or ongoing pregnancies.\n Among 12 patients who had suffered repetitive pregnancy losses, 11 desired pregnancy: 10 have been successfully pregnant beyond the second trimester (91.7%), 8 are delivered, and the living birth rate is 72.7%.\n These results equal those obtained after hysteroscopic metroplasty.\n The procedure is short, safe, requires no special equipment, and does not necessitate concomitant laparoscopy.",
