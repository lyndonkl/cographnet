  "text": "Growth abnormalities in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\n Growth abnormalities in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into two groups: local and systemic.\n Local disorders of growth often result in increased bone length and bone age or in marked decreases in longitudinal growth due to immobilization, premature epiphyseal closure, or fusion.\n Common growth defects seen in the knee, hand, wrist, hip, spine, and jaw are discussed.\n Systemic growth delay is most commonly secondary to active disease or treatment with corticosteroids.\n Nutritional aspects such as decreased appetite, reduced caloric intake, metabolic caloric requirements greater than available intake, or lack of essential vitamins could be the cause for decreased weight and stature.",
