  "text": "Change in sympathetic activity before, during, and after dialysis-induced hypotension.\n During the hemodialyses of eight patients with end-stage renal failure, who often had sudden-onset dialysis-induced hypotension, catecholamine (CA) levels were measured in the ultrafiltrate obtained by a mini-filter placed in series upstream of the dialyzer.\n The water evaporation rate from the skin (reflecting the perspiration rate) was also monitored.\n Results showed a temporary elevation in CA levels in the ultrafiltrate before hypotension occurred.\n This rise did not continue for long, returning to baseline when hypotension actually occurred.\n The temporary elevation may reflect transient compensation by the sympathetic nervous system for the decrease in vascular wall tension.\n It was also found that there was considerable water evaporation from the skin during hypotension.\n Because sweat gland activity is reflexively modulated by the baroreceptor, perspiration after a drop in blood pressure may reflect the normal diminiution in baroreceptor activity.",
