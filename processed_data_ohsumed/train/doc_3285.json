  "text": "Systemic amiloride inhibits experimentally induced neovascularization.\n Amiloride is an inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and might therefore have an inhibitory effect on neovascularization.\n Neovascularization was induced in rabbit corneas via local implantation of prostaglandin E1 pellets prepared in a slow-release polymer.\n Animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg of amiloride, or an equivalent volume of saline solution for 5 days; both were well tolerated without severe untoward effect.\n Neovascular response, as documented by corneal photographs, was evaluated after 5 days of injections.\n The area of induced corneal neovascularization was decreased by 55% in animals receiving amiloride when compared with controls.\n Thus, amiloride and similar compounds may prove useful in the study and management of neovascularization.",
