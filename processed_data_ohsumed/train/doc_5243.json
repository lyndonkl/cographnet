  "text": "Radiotherapy for palliation of locally advanced prostatic carcinoma.\n Some patients present with distressing symptoms due to locally advanced prostatic carcinoma which may be refractory to hormonal manipulation and/or surgical treatment.\n Over an 8-year period 26 patients received local palliative radiotherapy for recurrent bleeding and lower urinary outflow tract obstruction.\n All were treated with conventional external beam radiotherapy and all but 2 obtained useful palliation of symptoms, especially those with recurrent bleeding.\n We also found that radiotherapy could be given to the majority of patients on an out-patient basis in 2 or 3 fractions.\n This was well tolerated and there were few side effects.",
