  "text": "Cerebral glucose utilization during sleep in Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a PET study.\n Three right-handed male children (aged 5, 6, and 11 years) with signs, symptoms and/or history of the syndrome of acquired aphasia-epilepsy (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) were studied during drug-induced, electroencephalographically (EEG)-monitored sleep by positron-emission tomography (PET) and the [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) method.\n Our data demonstrate that in Landau-Kleffner syndrome, cerebral glucose utilization is not normal during sleep.\n The metabolic pattern varied between the children but the metabolic disturbances always predominated over the temporal lobes.\n They were right-sided, left-sided, or bilateral.\n In the two first patients, EEG recordings showed continuous spike-and-wave discharges during sleep and a right-greater-than-left asymmetry was observed in temporal areas.\n In patient 1, the asymmetry was associated with a relative increase of glucose utilization of the right posterior temporal region.\n In patient 2, the glucose utilization was relatively decreased in the left anterotemporal and left perisylvian regions.\n In patient 3, the sleep EEG showed no discharge and no significant asymmetry was observed; however, glucose utilization of both temporal lobes was decreased.\n Lower metabolic rates in subcortical structures than in cortex were also noted in the three children.\n This metabolic pattern may be related to the maturation of the central nervous system (CNS).",
