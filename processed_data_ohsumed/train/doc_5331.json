  "text": "On the need for erythropoietin treatment in dialysis patients. A Copenhagen City Dialysis Unit study \n We evaluated the need for erythropoietin (EPO) treatment in 134 end-stage renal disease patients assuming a level of hemoglobin below 6 mmol/l (9.6 g/dl) as indication for treatment.\n 91 patients (68%) fulfilled this criterion.\n Absolute contraindications in 2 patients were previous thrombotic encephalopathy and refusal of treatment.\n Relative contraindications due to cardiac disease were found in 3 patients.\n In 15 patients additional treatment was required because of hypertension (5) or deficiency states (10).\n The implications of elevated serum PTH and aluminum overload are discussed.",
