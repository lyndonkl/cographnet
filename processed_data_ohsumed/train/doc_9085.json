  "text": "Total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation in hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland.\n Hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple-gland hyperplasia has traditionally been treated by subtotal parathyroidectomy.\n Excellent results have been reported by some, particularly in primary hyperparathyroidism, but other have reported a significant incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism.\n Since 1979, we have chosen to avoid the possibility of remedial exploration of the neck and its attendant risks by treating all patients with primary and secondary hyperplasia with total parathyroidectomy and heterotopic autotransplantation.\n A total of 20 patients were studied.\n There were no failures of grafts and no operative complications.\n We conclude that this procedure is a reliable and safe alternative in the treatment of primary or secondary hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland.",
