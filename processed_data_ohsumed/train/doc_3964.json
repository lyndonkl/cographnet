  "text": "Extended hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n The results of extended hepatectomy in 25 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma performed over a 16 year period have been reviewed, analysed and compared with those of 144 patients who underwent lesser liver resection.\n Five left and 20 right extended hepatectomies were performed for tumours ranging from 3 to 20 cm in diameter.\n Seventeen (68 per cent) of the patients had non-cirrhotic livers.\n The major postoperative complications were: haemorrhage in five cases, major bile duct injury in three, subphrenic abscess in two, liver failure in one and wound dehiscence in one.\n The 30-day (operative) mortality rate was 12 per cent and the median survival duration, including operative mortality, was 9.7 (range 0.2-32.1) months.\n The survival rate was 46 per cent at 1 year, 33 per cent at 2 years and 22 per cent at 3 years.\n The morbidity, mortality and survival data of extended hepatectomy were comparable with the results of lesser hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n We conclude that extended hepatectomy is a worthwhile operation for large hepatocellular carcinomas and a viable alternative to liver transplantation.",
