  "text": "Successful CPR in a severely hypothermic patient using continuous thoracostomy lavage.\n Severe hypothermia with cardiopulmonary arrest often requires prolonged resuscitation while rewarming procedures are implemented.\n A 63-year-old male in cardiopulmonary arrest with a core body temperature of 23.7 C was resuscitated successfully after core rewarming by means of a two-chest-tube continuous thoracostomy lavage procedure.\n This lavage procedure resulted in effective and rapid rewarming after other conventional rewarming methods had failed.",
