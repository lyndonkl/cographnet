  "text": "Peak flow nasal patency indices and self-assessment in septoplasty.\n The present study evaluates the results of septoplasty monitored by the objective peak flow nasal patency indices and the subjective patient self-assessment scores of nasal obstruction.\n Mini-Wright peak flow meters were used.\n The peak flow nasal patency index was defined as the ratio between nasal and oral peak flow rates.\n Uni and bi-lateral, as well as ex and in-spiratory, indices were calculated.\n Both peak ex and in-spiratory flow nasal patency indices were significantly increased 1 and 6 months post-operatively, indicating improved nasal patency.\n The most marked post-operative increase of the nasal patency indices was seen for the preoperatively worst airway and the total airway.\n A weak significant positive correlation was found between the peak flow nasal patency indices and the patient mean self-assessment scores of the uni and bi-lateral nasal obstruction.\n The change of the peak flow nasal patency indices measured 6 months post-operatively correlated well with the patient overall assessment of the operative changes of the total nasal patency.\n The method was found quick and easy to handle in monitoring the effect of functional septoplasty and is recommended as an alternative to rhinomanometry.",
