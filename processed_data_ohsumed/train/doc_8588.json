  "text": "Replantation of the distal part of the leg.\n We successfully replanted five amputated legs in five patients and followed the patients for two years or more (average, six years and three months).\n Although some patients found it impossible to squat and to run because of joint contractures, muscle weakness, or deformities of the foot, all patients could perform other activities without difficulty.\n None had important pain or any intolerance to cold, and all were satisfied with the results of the replantation.",
