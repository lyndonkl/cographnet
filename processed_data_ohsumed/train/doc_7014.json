  "text": "Thallous chloride uptake and DNA profile in parathyroid adenomas.\n Thallium isotope scintigraphy is used to localize parathyroid adenomas but the mechanism underlying the technique is poorly understood.\n While larger adenomas are reliably localized the results are less certain for small tumours.\n This study explores the relationship between cellular DNA profile and thallium uptake (localization accuracy) in 24 parathyroid adenomas.\n The DNA profile was assessed using flow cytometry and standard subtraction thallium scintigraphy was performed before surgery.\n Fifteen of the 24 adenomas demonstrated excessive mitotic activity and 13 of these glands were accurately localized.\n Of the remaining nine glands, only five were localized accurately (P less than 0.01, chi 2 test including Yates' correction).\n This difference in thallium uptake could not be accounted for on the basis of gland weight.\n Thallium localization of parathyroid adenomas is related to mitotic activity.\n This may explain some of the limitations of this technique.",
