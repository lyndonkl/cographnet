  "text": "Anaesthetic hazards of aortocaval fistula.\n A 66-yr-old man was anaesthetized for repair of a suspected ruptured aortic aneurysm.\n He became deeply cyanosed and suffered two episodes of asystole as the surgeons entered the abdomen.\n After the aorta was cross-clamped his condition improved markedly and no further problems ensued.\n Surgical exploration demonstrated intact aneurysms of the aorta and left iliac artery, the former containing a 3-4 cm long aortocaval fistula.\n The aneurysms and fistula were repaired and his further course was uncomplicated.\n Potential causes for the cyanosis and cardiac arrest in this patient are discussed.",
