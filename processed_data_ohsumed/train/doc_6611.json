  "text": "Lymph node metastasis from papillary-follicular thyroid carcinoma in young patients.\n A total of 117 patients under 20 years of age with papillary and/or follicular thyroid cancer presented to the M.\n D.\n Anderson Cancer Center between 1949 and 1987.\n The most common presenting symptom was a cervical mass.\n Twenty percent of the patients had a history of prior irradiation.\n Sixty percent initially had palpable lymph nodes, while 26% who had clinically negative examinations had pathologically positive lymph nodes.\n Recurrence was highest in regional lymph nodes at 24%, with only a 4% recurrence rate at the primary site and a 3% recurrence rate at distant sites.\n There were no deaths due to the thyroid cancer.\n To maintain a low rate of recurrence, near-total thyroidectomy with neck dissection followed by iodine 131 treatment should be considered in these young patients.",
