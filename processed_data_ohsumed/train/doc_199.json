  "text": "External detection of pulmonary accumulation of indium-113m labelled transferrin in the guinea pig.\n Accumulation of radioisotope labelled transferrin in the lungs of guinea pigs was determined with an external detection system.\n The method is based on the intravascular and extravascular distribution of indium-113m labelled transferrin compared with the intravascular distribution of technetium-99m labelled red blood cells.\n Guinea pigs were given iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue and potent pulmonary vasodilator, and noradrenaline, a pulmonary vasoconstrictor, in an attempt to increase and decrease respectively the blood volume in the lungs.\n Neither agent altered transferrin accumulation in the lung by comparison with a saline infusion.\n Iloprost infused before and after oleic acid infusion reduced macro-molecular leakage when compared with oleic acid alone.\n These data suggest that the double isotope method can distinguish between hydrostatic and injury induced pulmonary oedema.",
