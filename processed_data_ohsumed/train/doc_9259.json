  "text": "Nature, nurture, nutrition: interdisciplinary programs to address the prevention of malnutrition and dehydration.\n Malnutrition and dehydration are common problems in nursing home patients.\n One explanation for this may be the large number of patients requiring feeding assistance.\n The Dysphagia Team at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Miami, Florida served as the primary source in the expansion of a nutritionally supportive environment to assist in the prevention of malnutrition and dehydration in patients with feeding/swallowing disorders.\n \"Silver Spoons,\" a program in which volunteers provide supervised feeding, \"Happy Hour,\" a time each day during which an atmosphere is provided that encourages socialization and hydration, and \"Second Seating,\" during which lunch is provided for patients who require modification of eating style, food texture, or timing are described.\n Analysis of the program's outcomes show it to be timely, pleasing to patients, and cost-effective.",
