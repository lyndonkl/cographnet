  "text": "Current trends in suture fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses.\n Corneal surgeons were surveyed with regard to their technique of suture fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses in the absence of posterior capsular support.\n Fifty-nine percent of the 260 respondents stated they perform the procedure almost exclusively during penetrating keratoplasty.\n Scleral fixation was marginally favored over iris fixation by these surgeons.\n Most intraoperative problems reported were related to the relative technical difficulty of the procedure, although transient hemorrhage from the ciliary body was also mentioned.\n Postoperative complications cited included mechanical problems involving the lens and iris, cystoid macular edema, glaucoma, and endophthalmitis.",
