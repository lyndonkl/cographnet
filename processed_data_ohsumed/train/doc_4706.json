  "text": "Postoperative analgesic requirements in patients exposed to positive intraoperative suggestions.\n OBJECTIVE--To establish whether positive suggestions given to a patient under general anaesthesia reduce postoperative pain and analgesic requirements.\n DESIGN--Prospective double blind randomised study.\n SETTING--Operating theatre and gynaecology ward of a teaching hospital.\n PATIENTS--63 Woman undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomised to be played either a tape of positive suggestions or a blank tape during the operation through a personal stereo system.\n INTERVENTIONS--Three women were withdrawn from the study.\n Anaesthesia was standardised for all of the women.\n Postoperative analgesia was provided through a patient controlled analgesia system for the first 24 hours.\n Pain scores were recorded every six hours.\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Morphine consumption over the first 24 hours after the operation; pain scores.\n RESULTS--Mean morphine requirements were 51.0 mg (95% confidence interval 42.1 to 60.0 mg in the women played positive suggestions; and 65.7 mg (55.6 to 75.7 mg) in those played a blank tape.\n The point estimate (95% confidence interval) for the difference of means was 14.6 mg (22.4%) (1.9 (2.9%) to 27.3 mg (41.6%] (p = 0.028).\n Pain scores were similar in the two groups.\n CONCLUSION--Positive intraoperative suggestions seem to have a significant effect in reducing patients' morphine requirements in the early postoperative period.",
