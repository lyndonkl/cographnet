  "text": "Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy.\n In miniature pigs, retinal veins were experimentally occluded using argon laser coagulation.\n Microvascular modifications leading to retinal hemorrhages and retinal edema were observed some hours after the occlusion.\n These lesions resolved progressively within 3 weeks after the occlusion, but in most cases ischemic retinal territories persisted.\n Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements, using double barrelled O2-sensitive microelectrodes, showed that all the ischemic areas were indeed hypoxic.\n In half of the experiments, preretinal and intravitreal new vessels grew on the ischemic territories.\n Tissue hypoxia appears to be a key step in triggering neovascularization.\n However, the critical level of hypoxia was not determined.",
