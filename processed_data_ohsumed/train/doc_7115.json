  "text": "Complications of stapled anastomoses in anterior resection for rectal carcinoma: colorectal anastomosis versus coloanal anastomosis.\n Postoperative results of 48 patients who underwent anterior resection using the EEA-stapler were evaluated.\n In all but 2 cases the indication for surgery was colorectal carcinoma.\n In 24 patients an anastomosis was created above the 5 cm level (above the anal verge: colorectal anastomosis) and in 24 at the 0-5 cm level (coloanal anastomosis).\n There was no perioperative mortality.\n The only complication observed in the colorectal anastomosis group was one case of late anastomotic stenosis.\n In the coloanal anastomosis group there were 4 cases with early anastomosis leaks, 3 cases with late stenosis and 5 cases with various degrees of late fecal incontinence, ultimately resulting in a permanent diverting stoma in 5 (10.4%) patients.\n We conclude that for rectal tumors the EEA-stapled anterior resection provides excellent functional results in most cases.\n Stapled coloanal anastomoses more often demonstrate various (early and late) complications.\n Nevertheless in spite of chronic discomfort, many patients still prefer their complaints to a permanent stoma.",
