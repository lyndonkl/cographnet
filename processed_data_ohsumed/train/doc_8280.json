  "text": "Perichondral grafting for cartilage lesions of the knee.\n Twenty-five patients with 30 chondral lesions of the knee were treated with an autogenous strip of costal perichondrium.\n The graft was fixed to the subchondral bone with Tissucol (Immuno, Vienna), a human fibrin glue.\n The leg was then immobilised for two weeks followed by two weeks of continuous passive motion.\n Weight-bearing was permitted after three months.\n The mean knee score (Ranawat, Insall and Shine 1976) changed from 73 before operation to 90 one year after; in 14 patients evaluated after two years there was no decrease.\n In 28 cases the defect was completely filled with tissue resembling articular cartilage.\n We conclude that in most cases perichondral arthroplasty of cartilage defects of the knee gives excellent results.",
