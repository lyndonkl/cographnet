  "text": "Carburetor burns: preventable injuries associated with high morbidity and frequent litigation.\n We have identified carburetor burns as a significant cause of preventable morbidity, both from long-term functional and cosmetic standpoints.\n The epidemiology of carburetor burns and our experience are described.\n All of our patients were male, with a mean age of 35 years.\n Average burn size was 11.3%.\n The anatomic distribution of these burns, most often on the dominant hand and on the face, contributes to the morbidity of these burns.\n This injury has been associated with increasingly frequent litigation.\n We believe that an active education campaign and the addition of warning labels to car engine compartments would make an impact in decreasing the incidence of carburetor burns.",
