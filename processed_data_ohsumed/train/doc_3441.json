  "text": "Percutaneous biliary drainage for high obstruction.\n PBD is the preferred route of palliative drainage for patients with high biliary obstruction.\n The frequency of bifurcational obstruction in this setting requires familiarity with drainages from both the right and the left transhepatic approach.\n The preferred right transhepatic approach is fluoroscopically guided; on the left, ultrasonography is the guidance of choice.\n Large caliber drainage catheters are required, and dilatation of the necessary transhepatic tracts is extremely painful unless adequate inhalation anesthesia or, preferably, epidural anesthesia, is provided.\n Long-term biliary drainage requires a choice between internal-external external drainage catheters and endoprostheses that is made by considering the patient's life expectancy and his or her adjustment to a stent extending to the outside.\n The feasibility of corrective procedures if an internal-external drainage catheter or an endoprosthesis becomes blocked needs to be considered before definitive placement.\n The interventional radiologist becomes intimately involved in the follow-up care of patients and frequently has to direct appropriate patient evaluation.\n Familiarity with antibiotic regimens is important.",
