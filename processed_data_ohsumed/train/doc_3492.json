  "text": "Augmentation mentoplasty using Mersilene mesh.\n Many different materials are available for augmentation mentoplasty.\n However, the optimal implant material for chin implantation has yet to be found.\n During the past several years, a number of experienced surgeons have turned to the use of Mersilene mesh.\n Mersilene mesh is a non-absorbable Dacron polyester fiber that can be conformed easily into layers to achieve tailored dimensions and shape.\n At the McCollough Plastic Surgery Clinic PA, Birmingham, Ala, 277 patients over a 10-year period underwent chin augmentation with Mersilene mesh implants.\n The material provides excellent tensile strength, durability, and surgical adaptability.\n The overall complication rate was 3.2% (nine patients); infection rate, 2.5% (seven patients); and removal secondary to infection, 1.7% (five patients).\n Based on this 10-year experience, Mersilene mesh remains our material of choice for chin augmentation.",
