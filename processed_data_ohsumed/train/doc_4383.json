  "text": "Aortic occlusion and vascular isolation allowing avascular hepatic resection.\n Occlusion of the supraceliac abdominal aorta and hepatic vascular isolation were employed in a series of 15 patients as a definitive method to allow avascular hepatic resection.\n The series was compared with an earlier group of patients treated conventionally.\n In the avascular hepatic resection group there was no mortality; hypotension did not occur at the time of hepatic vascular isolation; rapid, accurate excision of the hepatic lesions could be achieved in a bloodless field; resection of midline lesions and those involving the great veins was possible; and \"segmentectomies,\" or resections crossing segmental boundaries, could be performed where previously formal hepatic lobectomies were required.\n Concomitantly, the greatest amount of uninvolved hepatic parenchyma remained in situ.\n There was increased ease of operative management, reduced blood loss, and reduced operating time (mean, 2.8 hours).",
