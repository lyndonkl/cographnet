  "text": "Transthyretin receptors on human astrocytoma cells.\n Transthyretin (TTR), a transport protein for T4 and retinol-binding protein, is the principal T4-binding protein of cerebrospinal fluid.\n Its function in regard to the delivery of its ligands and in other respects is unclear.\n The binding of [125I] TTR to cultured human astrocytoma cells was studied to determine whether these cells carry receptors for TTR.\n Scatchard analysis was consistent with a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 3 nM.\n No significant cross-reactivity with transferrin or serum albumin was observed.\n Internalization of TTR was temperature dependent and proportional to receptor occupancy.\n Dilutions of cerebrospinal fluid displaced [125I]TTR in proportion to their content of radioimmunoassayable TTR and in parallel with purified TTR.\n The uptake and internalization of TTR increased in the presence of high T4 or T3 concentrations.\n These results demonstrate that TTR binds to specific high affinity receptors on human astrocytoma cells.\n Receptor binding of TTR provides a potential mechanism for the delivery of its ligands within the central nervous system.",
