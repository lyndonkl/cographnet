  "text": "Epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor alpha receptors and psoriasis.\n The abnormal growth and differentiation in psoriasis is reflected in the abnormal regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor/Transforming Growth Factor Alpha (EGF/TGF alpha) receptor metabolism.\n In psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin conditions these receptors are persistently expressed throughout the interfollicular epidermis as long as the growth stimulatory signal persists.\n One of the first biochemical signs of effective therapy of psoriasis is the return of the EGF/TGF alpha receptor pattern toward the primarily basilar distribution seen in normal human adult skin.\n Whether the abnormal expression of TGF alpha in the involved skin induces the persistent expression of EGF receptors is not known nor is the signal that causes the increased production of TGF alpha.\n Studies to determine what factors regulate EGF receptor expression and TGF alpha induction may yield important new insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of psoriasis.",
