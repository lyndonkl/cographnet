  "text": "Antinuclear antibodies in sera of patients with recurrent pregnancy wastage.\n Four groups of women were studied to determine whether low-level antinuclear antibody titers are associated with a higher risk for pregnancy loss.\n Group A consisted of 30 patients with a history of unexplained fetal losses.\n Group B consisted of 30 women with \"explained\" fetal losses (e.g., uterine septum or luteal phase defect).\n Ages and number of losses were comparable between the women in groups A and B.\n Group C consisted of 61 healthy pregnant women.\n Group D involved 61 healthy nonpregnant women of reproductive age.\n In groups A and B, 40% and 53.3% of the respective patients had antinuclear antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:40.\n In groups C and D the frequencies of positive antinuclear antibody titers were 8.2% and 5.6%, respectively.\n This study demonstrates a high prevalence of low-titer antinuclear antibody-positive serum in patients with explained and unexplained pregnancy losses.",
