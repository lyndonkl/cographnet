  "text": "Repair of the uterine cavity after hysteroscopic septal incision.\n We performed a follow-up hysteroscopy with multiple biopsies at different intervals after surgery in 19 women who underwent hysteroscopic septal incision.\n Seven days after operation the sectioned areas were very evident and not epithelialized (3 patients).\n At 14 days, the incised zone was depressed with scattered epithelialization (5 subjects).\n At 1 month, the sectioned surfaces were still depressed and uniformly covered by thin endometrium (5 cases).\n After 2 months the uterine cavity was almost normal with minimal tendency to central fundal adhesions (6 women).\n Thus, spontaneous healing processes after hysteroscopic metroplasty progressed regularly and completely and there is probably no reason to delay attempts at pregnancy for longer than two cycles after surgery.",
