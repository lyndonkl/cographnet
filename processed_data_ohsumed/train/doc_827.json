  "text": "Association of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) with herpes zoster.\n Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by massive distension of the colon in the absence of organic distal obstruction.\n The syndrome is associated with various unrelated and, most often, extra-abdominal causes.\n An association between Ogilvie's syndrome and herpes zoster has been reported only once, by Ceccese et al.\n in 1985.\n We present a second such case.\n This patient did not show evidence of any active illness other than the involvement of the T10 dermatome by herpes zoster.\n The patient's symptoms of colonic obstruction subsided with resolution of the zosteriform rash.",
