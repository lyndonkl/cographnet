  "text": "Characterization of periventricular edema in normal-pressure hydrocephalus by measurement of water proton relaxation times.\n The magnetic resonance longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and transverse relaxation time (T2) of the water proton of the periventricular white and cortical gray matter were measured for 17 control patients and 21 patients with suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).\n Of the latter group, 14 showed good response to shunting (true-NPH group) and seven showed no response (false-NPH group).\n In the true-NPH group, both the T1 and the T2 of the periventricular white matter were significantly prolonged compared to the control values, and slowly shortened after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting.\n The true-NPH group showed significantly longer T1 and T2 of the white matter than did the false-NPH group.\n The T1 and T2 of the white matter were longer than those of the gray matter in this group, which was the reverse of the relationship observed in the control patients.\n In the white matter of the false-NPH group, there was a significant prolongation of T1 only; no difference was seen in the T2 compared to control values.\n There was no change in either T1 or T2 of this region after CSF shunting.\n The false-NPH group showed no significant difference in either T1 or T2 between the white and the gray matter.\n There was no difference in either T1 or T2 of the gray matter between the false-NPH and control groups or between preshunt and postshunt measurements in each patient group.\n It is suggested that a distinction between true- and false-NPH, which cannot be made from the radiographic appearance alone, may be possible from measurement of relaxation times.\n The mechanism of varied relaxation behavior between two entities may be explained by a difference in properties of the biological water and its environment.",
