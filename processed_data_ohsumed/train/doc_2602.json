  "text": "Neuropsychological outcome of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n Thirty patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (15 with and 15 without postanoxic coma on admission) underwent a clinical examination and neuropsychological testing.\n In order to assess quality of life, they were compared to two matched control groups; 15 patients with previous myocardial infarction and 15 healthy subjects.\n None of the survivors showed severe neurologic impairment, and all had returned to self-sufficient physical activity.\n However, the behavior rating scale scores were significantly worse in patients with postanoxic coma.\n The processing ability linked to memory was significantly worse in the postanoxic coma group.\n Mood disorders were also observed in this group, but they did not have pathological significance.\n The remarkably low incidence of neurologic and psychological sequelae in these resuscitated patients, particularly in those with early clinical evidence of severe cerebral damage, is an encouraging result that supports the therapeutic systems development and efforts in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",
