  "text": "Severe aortic regurgitation as a late complication of temporal arteritis.\n Two patients with a remote history of pathologically documented giant cell arteritis developed severe regurgitation.\n The first patient developed severe aortic regurgitation five years after the pathologic documentation of giant cell arteritis of the temporal arteries.\n Giant cell arteritis involvement of the aortic root was confirmed.\n The second patient developed aortic regurgitation seven years after pathologic documentation of giant cell arteries of the temporal arteries.\n Although pathologic confirmation of the aortic root process was not obtained, this case strengthens the clinical association between giant cell arteritis of the temporal arteries and subsequent aortic root dilatation and severe aortic regurgitation.\n Observation for signs of de novo severe aortic regurgitation is indicated in follow-up of patients with temporal arteritis.",
