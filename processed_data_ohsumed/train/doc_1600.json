  "text": "Analgesia and removal of nasal packing.\n We present a prospective controlled trial, comparing methods of analgesia for the relief of discomfort on removing nasal packing, including a general discussion on the considerations for, and methods of, nasal tamponade.\n On the basis that nasal packing is likely to continue to be used frequently, nitrous oxide (as Entonox) is advocated as a safe and relatively cheap means of pain relief with a statistically significant advantage over papaveretum.",
