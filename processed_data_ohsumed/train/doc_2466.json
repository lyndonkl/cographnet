  "text": "Experimental cardiac tamponade: correlation of pressure, flow velocity, and echocardiographic changes.\n Seven episodes of experimental cardiac tamponade were induced in five anesthetized closed-chest dogs.\n Simultaneous pericardial and intracavitary pressures were synchronized with superior vena caval and transvalvular pulsed-Doppler flow tracings.\n The earliest indication of tamponade was the development of a negative transmural right atrial pressure that occurred during early ventricular diastole and was associated with echocardiographic evidence of right atrial collapse.\n This was also associated with reversal of diastolic flow in the superior vena cava and with diminished early diastolic flow velocity across the tricuspid as well as the mitral valve.\n During more advanced cardiac tamponade, the transmural right atrial pressure became negative during both early and late ventricular diastole as well as during isovolumic ventricular systole.\n This was associated with a disappearance of early diastolic ventricular filling and right ventricular diastolic collapse as observed on two-dimensional echocardiography.\n In hypotensive cardiac tamponade (cardiac output diminished by 70%), the decreased transmural right atrial pressure that developed during ventricular systole was accompanied by diminished antegrade flow in the superior vena cava.\n In advanced and hypotensive tamponade, ventricular filling occurred mainly during atrial contraction.",
