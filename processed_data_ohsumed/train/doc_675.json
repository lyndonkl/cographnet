  "text": "Circadian esophageal motor function in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function and may contribute to the development of complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n Using 24-hour ambulatory esophageal manometry, we compared the circadian esophageal motor activity of normal volunteers to that of patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of mucosal injury (no mucosal injury, esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus).\n The prevalence of a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid exposure time, and the frequency of nonperistaltic esophageal contractions during the supine, upright, and meal periods increased with increasing severity of mucosal injury.\n The median amplitude of esophageal contractions was compromised only in patients with a mechanically defective sphincter.\n This was particularly so in patients with stricture or Barrett's esophagus and was associated with an increased frequency of ineffective contractions (less than 30 mm Hg).\n These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury.\n This appears to be caused by persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter.\n The need for surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is implicated.",
