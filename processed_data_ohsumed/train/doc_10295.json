  "text": "Ocular trauma caused by exploding glass bottles containing dry ice and water.\n We treated three patients with severe ocular injuries caused by exploding glass bottles containing a mixture of dry ice chips and water.\n One patient had a corneal laceration and traumatic cataract with several retained intraocular glass fragments.\n The second had a scleral laceration without corneal or lenticular involvement.\n The third suffered a corneal-scleral laceration, with a total retinal detachment.\n Following surgery, two patients recovered 20/20 vision; the third patient regained only light perception.",
