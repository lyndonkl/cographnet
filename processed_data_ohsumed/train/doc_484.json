  "text": "Intracorporeal biliary lithotripsy.\n Most bile duct calculi can be removed with standard percutaneous or endoscopic techniques.\n Very large stones are the most common cause for failure.\n Intracorporeal lithotripsy, and EHL in particular, can be used safely in either the biliary tree or gallbladder to fragment these large stones and allow percutaneous removal or passage.\n Intracorporeal EHL requires direct vision to prevent damage to the bile duct mucosa.\n Intracorporeal laser lithotripsy may offer some safety advantages, but the laser requires much more expensive equipment than intracorporeal EHL.\n Additional studies are needed to determine the technique that is better in each circumstance.",
