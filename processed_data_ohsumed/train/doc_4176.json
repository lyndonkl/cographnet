  "text": "Management of premature removal of the percutaneous gastrostomy.\n Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become the preferred method of enteral access for nutritional support.\n With increased use of this modality, complications are encountered more frequently.\n Premature withdrawal, inadvertent removal of the gastrostomy tube within the first seven days after insertion, before adherence of the gastric serosa to the parietal peritoneum, has been an indication for laparotomy.\n This report describes the treatment of premature withdrawal by immediate endoscopic replacement.\n Over an 18-month period, 271 patients underwent insertion of a PEG.\n Five patients (1.8%) who inadvertently removed their gastrostomy tube within seven days of insertion were treated with immediate replacement using the retrograde string technique, avoiding laparotomy.\n All five PEGs were successfully replaced through the same gastrostomy site.\n Despite the presence of pneumoperitoneum, no patient developed peritonitis or other septic complications.\n Premature gastrostomy tube withdrawal is safely managed by endoscopic replacement and observation.\n Laparotomy is unnecessary and potentially meddlesome.",
