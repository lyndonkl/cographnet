  "text": "Activation and inducer subset phenotype of the lymphocytic infiltrate around epidermally derived tumors.\n An in situ analysis of the mononuclear cell infiltrate found in association with a range of benign, premalignant, and malignant epidermal tumors is described.\n The predominant cell phenotype was that of the recently described immunoregulatory helper/inducer T lymphocyte.\n A large number of lymphocytes expressed antigens associated with cellular activation, suggesting an ongoing immunologic response by the host against the tumor, although evidence of in situ proliferation of these cells was lacking.\n These findings suggest that the infiltrate found in association with cutaneous tumors does not represent passive accumulation of lymphocytes from the circulation but rather an active antitumor response.",
