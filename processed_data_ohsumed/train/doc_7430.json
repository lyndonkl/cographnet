  "text": "Late development of a squamous carcinoma in a reconstructed pharynx.\n We report a case in which a squamous cell carcinoma was found to have arisen from a delto-pectoral skin flap used in pharyngeal reconstruction.\n The flap had been forming a neo-pharynx for 24 years.\n No other signs of recurrent disease had developed in this period.\n This raises the possibility of tumour induction in heterotopic skin used for oropharyngeal reconstruction.",
