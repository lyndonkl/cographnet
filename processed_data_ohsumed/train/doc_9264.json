  "text": "Transfer of diabetes in mice prevented by blockade of adhesion-promoting receptor on macrophages.\n Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease with an autoimmune aetiology.\n The non-obese diabetic mouse is a good spontaneous animal model of the human disease, with IDDM developing in 50-80% of female mice by the age of 6 months.\n The disease can be transferred by splenic T cells from diabetic donors and is prevented by T-cell depletion.\n The mechanism(s) by which the beta cell is specifically destroyed is not known, but T cells and macrophages have both been implicated, based on the presence of macrophages in the infiltrated islet and the ability of chronic silica treatment to prevent disease.\n The monoclonal antibody 5C6 is specific for the myelomonocytic adhesion-promoting type-3 complement receptor (CR3 or CD11b/CD18) and does not bind to T cells.\n Here we show that blockade of macrophage CR3 in vivo prevents intra-islet infiltration by both macrophages and T cells and inhibits development of IDDM.\n We conclude that both T cells and macrophages have an essential role in the onset of IDDM.",
