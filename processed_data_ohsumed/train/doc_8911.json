  "text": "The role of medical schools in the prevention of alcohol-related problems.\n There is agreement that physicians can play a major role in the prevention of alcohol problems among their patients and that medical schools should prepare physicians for this role by teaching three major subject areas: knowledge, attitudes and clinical skills.\n Despite this agreement and the acknowledged high prevalence of alcohol problems in clinical populations, medical school coverage of these problems is not proportional to their importance.\n Barriers to adequate coverage of alcohol problems are traditional attitudes, confusion as to whether such problems are \"medical\" and lack of adequate faculty role models.\n These problems could be remedied by encouragement and training of interested faculty members, establishment of substance abuse centres in university medical schools, integration of alcohol-related material with relevant topics in all departments and inclusion of alcohol-related questions on medical qualifying exams.",
