  "text": "Nonoperative management of bile duct stones.\n The treatment of choice for most retained bile duct stones is by nonoperative means.\n If a T-tube is in place, percutaneous techniques via the T-tract are indicated.\n Percutaneous access via puncture of a Roux-en-Y loop is also practical.\n In the absence of a T-tube, retrograde endoscopic techniques should be used.\n Both techniques are very effective and safe.\n Stones in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts also can be treated nonoperatively.\n Endoscopic sphincterotomy has a role in the treatment of selected patients with gallstone pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis with in situ gallbladders.\n In difficult cases, endoscopic and percutaneous techniques are employed in combination.",
