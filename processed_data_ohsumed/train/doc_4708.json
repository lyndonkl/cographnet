  "text": "Rapid percutaneous tracheostomy \n We describe a new method of performing percutaneous tracheostomy rapidly and safely using a specialized instrument kit.\n The technique permits the safe insertion of a full-sized 7.0 (ID) or 7.5 mm (ID) cuffed cannula into the trachea within 1-2 min, through the membranous second intercartilagenous space.\n Animal studies have demonstrated a superior healing process compared to that seen after conventional tracheostomy techniques.",
