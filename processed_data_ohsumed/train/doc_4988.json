Safe and efficient methods of rewarming the patient.\n Hypothermia, a relatively common problem in the winter months, can cause significant morbidity.\n It presents in a variety of situations and affects a wide age range.\n Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, because the symptoms, which are primarily related to the central nervous system, are not distinctive.\n Appropriate management requires accurate measurement of core body temperature.\n Treatment is centered on rewarming the patient safely and efficiently while providing other supportive measures.\n Care should be taken to avoid arrhythmias.\n Simple precautions greatly reduce the risk of hypothermia.",
