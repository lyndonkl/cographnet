  "text": "Carcinoma of the male breast: a review of 41 cases.\n We reviewed the cases of 41 consecutive men treated for breast carcinoma from 1950 through 1987 at Vanderbilt University Affiliated Hospitals to examine controversies in and methods of therapy for this disease.\n Twenty-two patients (52%) had stage I or II lesions potentially curable by operative therapy.\n The overall 5-year survival rates were 100% for stage I, 65% for stage II, 56% for stage III, and 0% for stage IV.\n Radical mastectomy offered no advantage over modified radical mastectomy in terms of survival or rate of recurrence.\n Diagnosis at an early clinical stage and no finding of disease in axillary lymph nodes were important factors in survival in this series of patients.\n All tumors evaluated for hormone receptors were positive.\n Although experience was limited, encouraging results were obtained with the use of tamoxifen citrate in adjuvant as well as palliative roles.\n With the exception of a predominance of centrally located lesions and a uniquely high frequency of positive hormone receptor status, carcinoma of the male breast appears biologically similar to the disease in women, and treatment should be guided by similar principles.",
