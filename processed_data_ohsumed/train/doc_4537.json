  "text": "Facial muscle reanimation using the trigeminal motor nerve: an experimental study in the rabbit.\n Surgical repair of facial nerve deficits may be marred by lack of muscle control and donor region paresis.\n Using New Zealand white rabbits, a study was undertaken to evaluate facial muscle reanimation with a donor source not previously used: the motor division of the trigeminal nerve.\n The results were compared with the severed facial nerve and hypoglossal-facial coaptation.\n An atrophy scale was calibrated for facial muscles of the rabbit.\n Clinical, electromyographic, and histomorphometric findings confirmed that the trigeminal nerve was a suitable donor source.\n The neurorrhaphy produced an exponential rate of repair.",
