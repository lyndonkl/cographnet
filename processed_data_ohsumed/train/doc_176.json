  "text": "Tracheal reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene graft in dogs.\n Use of prosthetic materials for long-segment tracheal reconstruction has been limited owing to infection, graft migration, ingrowth of fibrous tissue, and stenosis.\n Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is flexible and porous, and it may resist infection more than previously used materials.\n We evaluated PTFE for use in long-segment tracheal reconstruction.\n A 5-cm segment of trachea was resected in 9 dogs and replaced with a 20-mm reinforced PTFE graft using 4-0 Vicryl sutures.\n In 2 control dogs, one tracheal arch was resected and a primary anastomosis was performed.\n The animals were followed up with weekly bronchoscopy and endoscopic photography.\n Euthanasia was performed at 16 weeks or when signs of respiratory distress developed.\n At postmorten examination, the anastomoses were examined grossly and with light and scanning electron microscopy.\n In all 9 dogs that underwent tracheal replacement with PTFE, granulation tissue developed at the anastomoses resulting in airway obstruction after 3 to 8 weeks.\n No epithelial growth occurred over the graft between the anastomoses.\n The control animals did well.\n We conclude that granulation tissue formation at the anastomosis and the lack of respiratory epithelial ingrowth across the graft makes PTFE unsuitable for long-segment tracheal reconstruction.",
