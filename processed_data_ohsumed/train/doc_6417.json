  "text": "Surgical treatment of cardiac myxomas: long-term results.\n Between 1965 and 1988, 22 patients underwent 24 operations for cardiac myxomas.\n Two patients had the complex myxoma syndrome.\n Mitral valve replacement was required at initial operation in 2 patients.\n One patient died perioperatively, and 5 others died subsequently.\n The 16 surviving patients recently underwent evaluation at a mean duration of 9 years after operation.\n Ten are asymptomatic and 6 have New York Heart Association class II symptoms.\n Nine patients continue to be employed.\n Eleven are in sinus rhythm, 3 have permanent pacemakers, and 2 have chronic atrial arrhythmias.\n Echocardiography showed atrioventricular valve insufficiency in 3 patients and reduced contractility in 4, but no new tumor recurrences.\n The long-term prognosis of this relatively large group of patients with cardiac myxomas has been good.\n Patients without the complex myxoma syndrome had no recurrence, whereas 2 patients did require reoperation for mitral valve replacement.\n Long-term disability and chronic arrhythmias have been infrequent, and functional status and employability of these patients have been very good.",
