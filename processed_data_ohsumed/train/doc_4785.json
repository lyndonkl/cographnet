  "text": "Secondary hypogonadism in hemochromatosis.\n Hemochromatosis is a rare disorder of iron storage.\n This report illustrates a case of hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism in a female with biopsy-proven hemochromatosis.\n Dynamic pituitary and gonadal testing revealed subnormal gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) but normal ovarian reserve, as shown by normal follicular stimulation with hMG.\n Thus, abnormalities of ovulation and menstruation in patients with hemochromatosis are most likely because of inadequate pituitary responsiveness to GnRH.",
