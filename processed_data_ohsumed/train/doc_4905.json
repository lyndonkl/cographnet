  "text": "Gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male. A presentation of Munchausen's syndrome by proxy.\n Munchausen's syndrome by Proxy is a well-described entity that may not always be immediately considered in a complicated case.\n We describe this syndrome being portrayed through the guise of gastrointestinal bleeding in a 15 month old male and discuss not only the difficulty involved in solidifying this diagnosis but also the consequences that may occur should this diagnosis not be entertained.\n Failure to diagnose Munchausen's syndrome by proxy often results from failure to consider the diagnosis.\n These cases frequently have specific characteristics that allow seasoned clinicians to suspect the diagnosis.\n Once the diagnosis is considered, it is crucial to take steps to protect not only the index patient but also siblings who not infrequently are also recipients of this life threatening form of child abuse.",
