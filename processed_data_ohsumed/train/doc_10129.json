  "text": "Parenchymal and vascular magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n Three-dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography is a new and noninvasive method for imaging the intracranial vasculature.\n The combination of magnetic resonance angiography and conventional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate brain parenchyma and vessels in 30 survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n Magnetic resonance imaging findings were abnormal in 33% of the patients, with no increased frequency of right hemispheric lesions.\n Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated good intracranial flow in all infants and demonstrable right internal carotid arterial flow in 35% of those patients with permanent carotid ligation.\n An abnormal magnetic resonance imaging study was found more often in infants with abnormal predischarge neurologic examination results.\n These techniques have several advantages over other neuroimaging modalities, including better definition of deep structures, myelin formation, and intracranial vasculature, the absence of bone artifact, and the elimination of catheter or contrast use.",
