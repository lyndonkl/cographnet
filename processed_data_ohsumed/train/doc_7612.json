  "text": "Normeperidine-induced seizures in hereditary coproporphyria.\n Seizures are common in acute exacerbations of hepatic porphyria, even though the etiology is not identified in most cases.\n We have reported a case of normeperidine-induced seizures in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria.\n Although meperidine is commonly used for pain control during acute attacks in these patients, this report suggests that meperidine is not a good analgesic choice in porphyria.\n Normeperidine-induced seizures in patients with porphyria may be treated by withdrawal of meperidine therapy and selective use of anticonvulsants.",
