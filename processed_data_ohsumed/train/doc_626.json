  "text": "Persistent mullerian duct syndrome.\n Persistent mullerian syndrome is rare.\n A case of phenotypically normal male with persistent mullerian structures that consisted of a bicornuate uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina is reported.\n These unusual structures were found in association with bilateral cryptorchidism and a right inguinal hernia, and were diagnosed while repairing the hernia in the neonatal period.\n The uterus and fallopian tubes were removed via laparotomy when the child was eighteen months old; at the same time a bilateral orchiopexy was performed.\n To avoid damage to the vas deferens, which lay in closely to the mullerian structures and could not be separated from the vaginal wall, a small segment of the upper third of the vagina was retained.\n The testicles, although normal on pathologic examination, have shown poor response to hormonal stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin.\n Long-term follow-up for these patients is necessary because they have an increased risk of testicular tumors developing.",
