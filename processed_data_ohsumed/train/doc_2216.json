  "text": "Improved cannulation method for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been shown to be useful for patients in reversible cardiogenic shock.\n Effective arterial cannulation techniques for infants have been developed that are simple to use and require minimal subsequent vascular repair or reconstruction after removal.\n Groin cannulation in adults frequently requires bidirectional arterial cannulation to ensure adequate distal perfusion as well as frequent complex arterial repairs after discontinuation.\n We describe a simple arterial cannulation technique using a single right-angle, high-flow arterial cannula.\n With this technique adequate bidirectional arterial perfusion is maintained with a single arterial cannula while the need for vascular repairs or reconstruction is minimized.",
