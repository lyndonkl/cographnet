  "text": "Argon versus krypton panretinal photocoagulation side effects on the anterior segment.\n The modification of corneal sensitivity, accommodation, pupillary diameter and endothelial cell density after argon versus krypton panretinal photocoagulation were studied prospectively in 88 eyes of 64 diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, randomized for one of the two laser treatments.\n In both groups a marked internal ophthalmoplegia and reduction of corneal sensitivity occurred after laser photocoagulation.\n At no time, 2, 90 and 180 days after PRP, were these parameters significantly different.\n Endothelial cell loss was non significantly greater in the krypton group.\n The results indicated that the side effects commonly observed on the anterior segment after PRP are comparable using argon or krypton lasers.",
