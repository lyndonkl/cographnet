  "text": "Formoterol in the treatment of nocturnal asthma.\n Formoterol fumarate is a new beta 2-adrenergic agonist with a long lasting effect.\n The bronchospasmolytic effect of 12 micrograms of formoterol was compared with that of 200 micrograms of albuterol (salbutamol) in a single-center, double-blind, randomized within-patient study.\n The drugs were given as aerosols by MDI to 16 patients with nocturnal asthma in a stable phase.\n The inhalations were given at 10 PM and the FEV1 values as parameter were measured before and at 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours afterwards.\n The FEV1 6 hours after administration of formoterol was significantly higher than that after albuterol (ANCOVA: p = 0.008), and this was still the case 12 hours after the test dose at 10 AM the following morning (ANCOVA: p = 0.009).\n At 4 AM, the FEV1 fell below the basic starting value after albuterol, whereas it remained at least 10 percent above the formoterol inhalation.\n Five patients required rescue therapy after albuterol and two after formoterol.\n We conclude that formoterol in a dose of 12 micrograms via MDI confers good protection against nocturnal asthma; this was only insufficient for some patients with severe asthma, and further studies with higher dosages in these patients are clearly indicated.",
