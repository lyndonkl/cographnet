  "text": "Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery.\n A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery.\n Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up.\n Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery.\n The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months).\n The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%).\n All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure.\n The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus.\n Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy.\n Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures.\n The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001).\n Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery.\n Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005).",
