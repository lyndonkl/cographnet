  "text": "Results in 104 patients undergoing bronchoplastic procedures for bronchial lesions.\n Bronchoplastic procedures were used in 104 patients with various bronchial disorders.\n Ten had benign lesions and 94, malignant tumors.\n The principal operative procedures were sleeve lobectomy and sleeve pneumonectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma, but 11 limited bronchial resections were performed in patients with benign lesions, minute bronchogenic carcinomas, and low-grade malignant tumors.\n Of the 94 patients with malignant tumors, 79 underwent a bronchoplastic procedure without carinal resection (sleeve lobectomy in 75 and limited bronchial resection in 4), and there was one operative death (1.3%).\n The overall 5-year survival rate for the patients with bronchogenic carcinoma in this group was 45% and that for patients undergoing curative resection, 57% (survival of patients in stages I, II, and IIIA was 79%, 55%, and 30%, respectively).\n A bronchoplastic procedure with carinal resection was performed in 15 patients.\n Twelve in this group underwent sleeve pneumonectomy.\n There were two operative deaths, and 1 patient has survived for longer than 4 years.\n Two patients with low-grade malignant tumors underwent carinal resection without lung resection and are still alive.\n We believe that bronchoplasty is a safe and valuable procedure and that limited bronchial resection appears to be the procedure of choice for localized bronchial lesions.",
