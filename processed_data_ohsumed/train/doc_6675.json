  "text": "Papanicolaou smear cell recovery techniques used by primary care physicians.\n Nine hundred Tennessee-based internists, family physicians, and obstetrician-gynecologists were randomly selected and surveyed to identify Papanicolaou smear cell recovery methods used in their practices.\n This 16-item survey also requested typical laboratory reporting procedures on Papanicolaous smears.\n The most frequently reported cell sampling technique was the combination cotton-tipped applicator and spatula, which was used by 47 percent of all physicians.\n Use of the cervical cytobrush for Papanicolaou smears, which has been shown to improve the detection of cervical dysplasia, was used alone or in combination by 19 percent of those surveyed, of whom 72 percent were gynecologists.\n Cervical sampling should contain cells from the transformation zone as evidenced by an adequate number of endocervical cells on the smear.\n Laboratories reporting the presence of endocervical cells were significantly different (P less than 0.05) among the specialties, with 26 percent of the internists', 18 percent of the family physicians', and 15 percent of the obstetricians' laboratories not providing this information in their reports.\n Reporting inadequate smears is a necessary first step toward improved sampling technique.\n Without this information, physicians risk missing pathology through reports of false-negative Papanicolaou smears.",
