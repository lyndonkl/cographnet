  "text": "Mohan's urethral valvotome: a new instrument.\n Electrothermic fulguration of posterior urethral valves with a resectoscope is difficult in newborns, especially in small for gestation date and premature newborns because of a small caliber urethra.\n This difficulty has prompted the innovation of the valvotome described.\n The outer diameter of the valvotome is 3 mm.\n and it can be easily introduced without stretching the urethra.\n This instrument has been used successfully in 8 patients to date.\n Patient age ranged from 3 days to 3 1/2 years with varying degrees of hydronephrosis and hydroureter.\n All patients have a good urinary stream with regression of the hydronephrosis and hydroureter.",
