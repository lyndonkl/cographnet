  "text": "Humoral factors determining the blood pressure response to converting enzyme inhibition and calcium channel blockade.\n Renin and catecholamine levels were determined in patients with mild to moderate hypertension before and after treatment with sustained release diltiazem or captopril and were correlated with the blood pressure response to these antihypertensives.\n Eight weeks of treatment with either agent led to equal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\n Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine did not predict the blood pressure response to either agent.\n Diltiazem significantly increased both PRA and supine norepinephrine levels.\n However, in the diltiazem treated patients, there was no correlation between the change in plasma norepinephrine and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure.\n In contrast, there was a negative correlation (P less than .05) between the reactive rise in PRA and the decrease in systolic blood pressure.\n Thus, the antihypertensive response to a calcium channel blocker may be determined, in part, by the reactive response of pressor systems.",
