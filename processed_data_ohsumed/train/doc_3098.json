  "text": "Abnormal bleeding in the climacteric.\n In the perimenopausal years, we encounter a situation where the normal diminution in reproductive capacity, with its resulting disruption of the normal menstrual hormonal pattern, coincides with a very real risk of pelvic pathology.\n Limitation in the ability to diagnose and to treat these patients conservatively has in the past resulted in a high rate of hysterectomy.\n With increased understanding of the normal physiology of this stage of transition and with improved diagnostic tools, we are now able to come to a definitive diagnosis in most patients.\n This ability to assure the diagnosis has made it much easier to counsel the patient confidently about the appropriate course of action.\n We will continue to encounter the problem of hysterectomy for bleeding with no histologic lesion being found.\n Although reviewers' letters may be considered an unnecessary thorn in the side, the improved practice that has resulted from these efforts gives strong support to their continued activities.\n We can have confidence that our treatment plan evolved in a logical manner and offers our patients a high probability of benefit at justifiable risk.",
