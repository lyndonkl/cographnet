  "text": "Coupling of beta-cell desensitization by hyperglycemia to excessive stimulation and circulating insulin in glucose-infused rats.\n Nondiabetic rats were infused with glucose for 48 h to maintain moderate or marked hyperglycemia (mean blood glucose 13.2 +/- 0.7 or 22.8 +/- 0.3 mM, respectively).\n The two levels of hyperglycemia increased plasma insulin levels severalfold but decreased the insulin response to 27 mM glucose by 19 and 95%, respectively, versus saline infusion.\n Diazoxide (5 mg.kg-1.h-1), when continuously infused during the hyperglycemia protocols, completely inhibited the glucose-induced rise in plasma insulin levels.\n Diazoxide transformed beta-cell insensitivity to stimulation: glucose-induced insulin release was thus increased 318% after moderate hyperglycemia and 707% after marked hyperglycemia.\n These stimulatory effects of diazoxide were reversed by exogenous insulin infusion (8 or 2 U/24 h) in a dose-dependent manner.\n It is concluded that excessive beta-cell stimulation rather than glucotoxicity underlies hyperglycemia-induced beta-cell insensitivity.\n Effects of hyperinsulinemia can form part of the mechanisms whereby excessive stimulation affects beta-cell secretion.",
