  "text": "Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening activities of state health agencies: a survey \n Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening has been demonstrated to be cost-effective on a population basis and is becoming standard practice.\n The American Society of Human Genetics has twice published policy statements to define the essential elements of a quality screening program.\n The present study reviewed the impact of these policy statements on state public-health agencies with respect to regulation or provision of MSAFP screening in their jurisdictions.\n With a few exceptions, states have not elected to play a major role in provision or regulation of this test.\n There is need to address issues of funding, standards, and data collection in a collaborative effort, if policy statements on genetic services are to be translated into effective state population screening.",
