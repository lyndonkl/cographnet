  "text": "Pediatric osteosarcoma: therapeutic strategies, results, and prognostic factors derived from a 10-year experience.\n Ninety-eight pediatric patients were treated with three separate protocols (Treatment and investigation of Osteosarcoma [TIOS] I, II, and III) and 47 developed recurrent disease (metastases and/or local recurrence).\n Actuarial overall disease-free survival (hereafter designated survival) was 43%.\n Over 90% of the patients were treated initially with preoperative intraarterial cisplatin (CDP).\n Postoperative chemotherapeutic regimens comprised high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (MTX-CF), Adriamycin [( ADR] doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide.\n Primary definitive treatment comprised amputation or limb salvage (TIOS I and TIOS III).\n Patients treated with preoperative CDP and surgery (TIOS I and III) had a 62% survival.\n Patients in TIOS II refused surgical extirpation; they were treated exclusively with chemotherapy and had a 23% survival.\n Survival in patients treated with amputation was 55% and limb salvage 58%.\n Prognostic factors considered significant in relation to development of pulmonary metastases comprised tumor burden (P = .04) and the percentage of tumor necrosis induced by preoperative chemotherapy (P = .01).\n Histopathologic subtype was marginally significant: chondroblastic was more favorable as opposed to osteoblastic (P = .05).\n These findings are compared with results and prognostic factors published in the literature.",
