  "text": "Continence level following radical prostatectomy.\n The relationship of the urethral anastomosis and postoperative continence following radical prostatectomy is uncertain.\n The objective of this study was to determine radiographically the functional level of continence following radical prostatectomy relative to the site of the intraoperative urethral anastomosis.\n In 8 patients having a radical prostatectomy, an intraoperative hemoclip was placed at the site of the urethral anastomosis and the postoperative functional level of continence was determined using a standing lateral cystogram.\n The functional level of continence was 9 mm (SD = 3.0) distal to the site of the urethral anastomosis.\n The level in the urethra that continence occurs may be a function of the intrinsic continence parameters of each individual patient.",
