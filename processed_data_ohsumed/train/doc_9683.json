  "text": "Effect of education on the use of universal precautions in a university hospital emergency department.\n STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine if an educational program would improve both knowledge and practice of universal precautions by nursing personnel.\n DESIGN: Participants were given a 14-question test and observed for their, practice of universal precautions during routine IV catheter placement or phlebotomy and trauma care before and six months after an education in-service.\n SETTING: University hospital emergency department.\n TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Nursing personnel.\n INTERVENTIONS: One-hour lecture addressing the occupational risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the recommended use of universal precautions.\n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean overall correct response rates to the questionnaire before and after the in-service were 70% and 73%, respectively (P = NS).\n The pattern of incorrect responses suggested that the perceived risks of HIV transmission are underestimated, particularly among healthy-appearing patients.\n For care of critical trauma patients, there were significant increases between the frequency rates before and after the in-service of glove and protective eyewear use (66.7% vs 87.7%, P less than .025; 0.0% vs 17.3%, P less than .05, respectively).\n The frequency rates of glove use for IV placement or phlebotomy in noncritical patients and of gown use for trauma patient care also increased (52.6% vs 65.2% and 25% vs 39.5%, respectively); however, these changes were not statistically significant.\n CONCLUSION: An intensive educational program was associated with a modest increase in the compliance of ED nursing personnel with universal precautions and had no long-term effect on their general knowledge of HIV risk.\n The practice of universal precautions is still far from universal in this ED.",
