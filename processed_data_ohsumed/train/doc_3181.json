  "text": "A randomized, controlled trial of clomiphene citrate and intrauterine insemination in couples with unexplained infertility or surgically corrected endometriosis.\n This study was initiated to test the hypothesis that treatment with clomiphene citrate (CC) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) results in increased fecundity when compared with periovulatory intercourse in couples with either unexplained infertility or surgically corrected endometriosis.\n Sixty-seven couples entered a randomized, prospective trial comparing CC/IUI with observation.\n During the study, there were 14 pregnancies in 148 treated cycles (fecundity = 0.095) compared with 5 pregnancies in 150 untreated cycles (fecundity = 0.033).\n Using life-table analysis and the log-rank test, the difference in fecundities was statistically significant.\n Pregnancy outcome was not significantly different between the two groups.\n When comparing conception with nonconception cycles during treatment, no differences between the size of the lead follicle or the number of dominant follicles was detected.\n We conclude that treatment with CC/IUI improves fecundity in couples with unexplained infertility or surgically corrected endometriosis.",
