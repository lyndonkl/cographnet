  "text": "Cytomegalovirus in a macerated second trimester fetus: persistent viral inclusions on light and electron microscopy.\n The macerated stillborn fetus represents at least one third of all perinatal deaths.\n Microscopic examination of these specimens is often unrewarding.\n We have reported a clinically unsuspected cytomegalovirus infection in a second trimester macerated fetus.\n Cells suggestive of CMV inclusions were identified by light microscopy, but electron microscopy confirmed the presence of viral infection and proved valuable in making the diagnosis even though necrosis was severe.",
