  "text": "Visualization of acute pulmonary emboli by transesophageal echocardiography.\n This report describes a patient who became hypoxic and hypotensive while awaiting cardiac surgery.\n An urgent transesophageal echocardiogram in the operating room showed a mass at the junction of the main and right pulmonary arteries consistent with thrombus.\n The thrombus was removed surgically, and the patient then had a successful aortic valve replacement.\n Transesophageal echocardiography is therefore useful in the evaluation of the critically ill patient.",
