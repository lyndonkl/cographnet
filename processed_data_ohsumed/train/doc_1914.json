  "text": "Left ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement measured by ultrafast computed tomography.\n Left ventricular mass and function were measured using ultrafast computed tomography, and were correlated with clinical status in 17 patients with aortic stenosis and/or insufficiency undergoing aortic valve replacement or balloon valvuloplasty.\n Wall mass was 159 +/- 38 gm/m2 initially, decreased 25% to 116 +/- 29 gm/m2 at 4 month (p less than 0.001), and decreased a total of 34% to 105 +/- 33 gm/m2 at 8 months after valve repair.\n By 8 months not only was the mean wall mass within the normal range, but only three patients retained abnormal hypertrophy.\n Ejection fraction increased 8% (p = 0.06).\n Clinical function improved in all patients, with only three patients remaining outside of New York Heart Association functional class 1 at 8 months.\n Regression of ventricular mass into the normal range correlated with attainment of class 1 functional status (p less than 0.02), despite a lack of increase of ejection fraction.\n The single patient followed for 8 months after valvuloplasty had minor wall mass regression and minor clinical improvement.",
