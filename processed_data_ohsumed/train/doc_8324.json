  "text": "The expression of retrovirus-like particles in psoriasis.\n Retrovirus-like particles have been isolated from patients with psoriasis.\n Antigens crossreacting with the major internal protein, pso p27, of these particles have been demonstrated in the wall of dermal vessels and in a subfraction of cells in psoriatic lesions.\n The antigen has also been observed in blood lymphocytes from psoriatic patients.\n Pso p27 antigen and anti-pso p27 antibodies are present as complement-activating immune complexes in psoriatic scale and in the blood of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n The potential contribution of the circulating immune complexes to the inflammatory process in psoriasis is discussed.",
