  "text": "Promoting adherence to low-fat, low-cholesterol diets: review and recommendations.\n Evidence that lowering blood cholesterol levels reduces risk of coronary heart disease has prompted widespread recommendations that hyperlipidemic individuals undergo dietary therapy.\n However, the extent to which people can adopt and maintain diets to lower lipids is unclear.\n In our article, we review what is currently known regarding adherence to low-fat diets and present an approach to dietary counseling for lowering cholesterol that incorporates elements of behavioral self-management and social learning theory.\n We discuss specific recommendations for counseling hyperlipidemic patients based on the Dietary Alternatives Study.\n Recommendations include providing patients with an adequate knowledge base to make dietary changes, using goal setting and self-monitoring to help patients initiate dietary changes, enlisting support from the patient's family, and enhancing self-efficacy to promote long-term dietary maintenance.",
