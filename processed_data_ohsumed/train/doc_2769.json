  "text": "The effects of dopamine on myocardial functional recovery after reversible ischemic injury.\n Dopamine frequently is used to improve cardiac performance after acute myocardial ischemia.\n Inotropic agents, however, increase myocardial oxygen demand and could potentially delay recovery from ischemic injury.\n To evaluate this problem, we studied eight chronically instrumented dogs in the conscious state and performed two 15-minute coronary occlusions 48 hours apart.\n After one of the occlusions, either dopamine (15 micrograms/kg/min) or saline placebo was administered intravenously from 1.0 to 1.5 hours of reperfusion.\n The alternative infusion was given during the second study.\n Preload recruitable work area, the area beneath the stroke work versus end-diastolic length relationship, was used to assess intrinsic myocardial performance.\n Ischemia decreased preload recruitable work area to 13% of control after both occlusions.\n After reperfusion, a 30-minute dopamine infusion acutely increased myocardial function nearly threefold as compared with placebo.\n Myocardial performance after dopamine administration, however, was significantly depressed compared with placebo throughout the remaining 24 hours of reperfusion (p less than 0.01).\n These data indicate that dopamine may impair functional recovery after ischemic myocardial injury and suggest that inotropic interventions should be used in this setting only when absolutely indicated.",
