  "text": "The Maylard incision in gynecologic surgery \n The transverse muscle-splitting Maylard incision was used in 175 gynecologic patients who required pelvic-abdominal surgery.\n One hundred fifty-three patients (87%) had pelvic malignancy; other indications for operation included uterine myomas, endometriosis, tuboovarian abscess, and benign ovarian cysts.\n Exposure was excellent: 54% of patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and 17% underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy.\n Twelve patients (6.9%) had wound complications, but there was neither long-term morbidity nor mortality associated with the incision.\n Fifty-six patients (32%) received preoperative or postoperative pelvic radiation therapy with no detrimental effect on wound healing.\n The Maylard incision is cosmetic, strong, easily learned, and has an acceptable complication rate.\n Unless a vertical incision is indicated, the Maylard technique is preferred when optimal exposure and accessibility to the pelvis are required.",
