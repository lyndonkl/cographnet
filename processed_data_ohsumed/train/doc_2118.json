  "text": "The De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty. Perioperative mortality and long term follow-up.\n One hundred and fifty-three patients undergoing De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty, with or without other associated cardiac procedures between January, 1979, and June, 1987, were evaluated.\n There were 136 hospital survivors.\n The follow-up was 98.1% complete for a mean of 3.7 years/patient.\n Operative mortality was 11.1%; preoperative NYHA class and length of CPB were significant risk factors of perioperative mortality.\n The actuarial survival of operative survivors at 9 years was 73.5 +/- 11.8%.\n There were 7 late cardiac deaths among a total of 12 late deaths.\n Eleven patients required reoperation (2.1 +/- 0.6% patient-year).\n In seven patients it was necessary for recurrence of tricuspid regurgitation; six of these had also a mitral prosthesis malfunction or a periprosthetic leak.\n Residual tricuspid regurgitation was judged as mild, moderate or severe in 29.9%, 11.9% and 4.3% of the patients respectively.\n De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty is the method of choice for mild and moderate tricuspid insufficiency; in selected cases, with a more severe degree of regurgitation, better results could be achieved with a different surgical approach.",
