  "text": "Management of mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta after heart-lung transplantation.\n A 19-year-old woman underwent heart-lung transplantation for obstructive bronchiolitis.\n Eleven days later mycotic rupture of the ascending aorta occurred.\n Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted via the femoral vessels and the chest was reopened under cardiac massage.\n Perforation of the aorta at the site of insertion of the cardioplegic cannula in the donor aorta was seen.\n Under circulatory arrest the infected area was excised, a pericardial patch plasty was performed, and the region was covered with a muscle flap.\n Postoperatively, Candida albicans was found in the excised specimen of the aorta, in drainage fluid, and in the bronchoalveolar lavage.\n High doses of antimycotics were administered intravenously and for irrigation of the mediastinum, which resulted in an eradication of fungi in all cultures 7 days later.\n Six weeks after reoperation the patient was discharged home, and she remains well 9 months postoperatively.",
