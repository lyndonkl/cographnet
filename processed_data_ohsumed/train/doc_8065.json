  "text": "Influence of amphetamine treatment on somatosensory function of the normal and infarcted rat brain.\n The consequences of acute amphetamine administration on the metabolic responsiveness of the cerebral cortex to physiologic activation were studied in normal and infarcted rats.\n Treated rats received a 4 mg/kg intravenous injection of d-amphetamine 1 hour before unilateral vibrissae stimulation and 2-deoxyglucose study.\n In nontreated normal rats, metabolic activation was restricted to the major relay stations of the vibrissae-barrel circuit.\n In amphetamine-treated rats, stimulation-induced increased glucose utilization was widespread, including ipsilateral and contralateral cortical regions outside the barrel field circuit.\n For example, an 84% increase in glucose utilization above control was seen in cortical areas anterior to the barrel field region.\n Increased glucose utilization induced by stimulation was severely depressed in nontreated rats that had undergone infarction of the left cortical barrel field 2 weeks previously.\n Vibrissae stimulation failed to increase glucose utilization significantly in cortical areas remote from the infarct.\n In contrast, bilateral increases in glucose utilization were observed within cortical regions of treated infarcted rats.\n For example, a 50% increase in glucose utilization was detected in cortical areas bordering the infarct.\n Thus, in the normal and infarcted rat, amphetamine appears to promote alternate circuit activation--a pharmacologic property that may be advantageous for recovery after injury.",
