  "text": "Seroprevalence of HIV infection in the general population of the Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa.\n A seroepidemiological survey to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the general population of the Ivory Coast was carried out in February 1989.\n Sera were collected from subjects between 15 and 65 years old in urban areas (not including Abidjan) and rural areas using the cluster sample technique.\n A total of 1,700 people were tested in urban areas, and 125 (7.3%) were HIV positive.\n This rate varied significantly with age and sex; a maximum rate of 16.3% was observed among men between 35 and 44 years old.\n In rural areas, a total of 3,199 people were tested, and 159 (4.9%) were positive for HIV; the highest rate (10.7%) was noted in the men aged 25-34 years.\n The high seroprevalence recorded in the general population in urban and rural areas is compatible with the incidences of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases reported in hospitals all over the country.",
