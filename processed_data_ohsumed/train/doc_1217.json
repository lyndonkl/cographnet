  "text": "Recurrent seizures in children with Shigella-associated convulsions.\n Fifty-five children with Shigella-associated convulsions were followed prospectively to investigate their risk of subsequent febrile or nonfebrile seizures.\n The duration of the follow-up period was between 6.9 and 14.1 years (9.7 +/- 3.1 years).\n No case of nonfebrile seizures and only 2 cases (3%) of subsequent febrile seizures were observed during this period.\n We conclude that although febrile and Shigella-associated convulsions share many clinical features, the natural history of these two conditions seems to be distinctly different.\n Shigella-related convulsions are not associated with an increased incidence of subsequent febrile or nonfebrile convulsions.",
