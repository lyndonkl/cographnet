  "text": "Constipation: pathophysiology and treatment.\n Although many physicians consider constipation a trivial problem, it is one of the most frequent and chronic digestive disorders in the United States, affecting 4.53 million people and causing considerable morbidity.\n More than $200 million are spent for over-the-counter laxatives and untold millions of dollars are spent for prescription drugs and other medical services to manage this disorder.\n Successful management requires an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem, an understanding of colorectal function and a clear assessment of the causes.\n Careful examination of the patient's anorectal anatomy and improvement in the patient's dietary habits are the first steps in management.\n Therapeutic options include behavioral modification strategies, diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacologic therapy and, rarely, surgical intervention.",
