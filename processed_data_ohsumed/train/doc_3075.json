  "text": "The significance of moderate and severe inflammation on class I Papanicolaou smear \n The significance of a cytologic diagnosis of moderate and severe inflammation with a normal (class I) Papanicolaou smear has not been addressed.\n A retrospective review of 596 consecutive cervical smears performed over 13 months revealed 85 women who had a class I cytologic smear with moderate to severe inflammation.\n Seventy-eight patients had colposcopic examinations and were considered for this study.\n Fifty-nine (75.6%) had cervical punch biopsies and/or endocervical biopsies.\n Of the 78, 19 (24.4%) had cervical condylomata and nine (11.5%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\n We conclude that class I cytologic smears with moderate to severe inflammation may be associated with findings of condylomata and cervical dysplasia.",
