  "text": "131I treatment of thyroid papillary carcinoma in a patient with renal failure.\n Procedures for 131I ablation in renal failure are not known.\n In one patient receiving dialysis, detailed dosimetry and health safety aspects were obtained.\n The results showed insignificant contamination of equipment, but a surprisingly significant reduction in biologic half-life of 131I due to efficient dialysis extraction.\n The data indicate that 131I ablation can be done safely and easily during dialysis but that much higher 131I doses must be used to achieve equivalent results to those obtained in patients with normal renal function.",
