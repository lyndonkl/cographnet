  "text": "Through-knee amputation in high-risk patients with vascular disease: indications, complications and rehabilitation.\n During a 10-year period 104 patients (mean age 72 years) had 106 through-knee amputations.\n Indications for surgery were: limb gangrene, 67 (64 per cent); ischaemic ulceration, 22 (21 per cent); rest pain, 9; knee contractures, 6.\n Thirty patients had had previous unsuccessful vascular reconstructive surgery and five had had a failed femoral embolectomy.\n The through-knee disarticulation used lateral skin flaps.\n The mortality was 21 (20 per cent).\n Of the 83 survivors, 59 (71 per cent) underwent uncomplicated primary wound healing; 36 (43 per cent) of the survivors were unsuitable for rehabilitation on a prosthesis.\n The remaining 47 (57 per cent) were walking before discharge 30-130 days (mean 68 days) after amputation.\n Through-knee amputation is a rapid, relatively bloodless, amputation and is a useful debridement procedure.\n The many surgical and functional advantages, in conjunction with the recent reports of better rehabilitation compared with the above-knee or Gritti-Stokes amputation, suggests that the through-knee amputation deserves greater consideration.",
