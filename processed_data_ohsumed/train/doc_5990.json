  "text": "Immunological studies of the basis for the apathogenicity of simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys.\n Potential reasons for the lack of pathogenicity of the simian immunodeficiency virus SIVagm in its natural host, the African green monkey (AGM, Cercopithecus aethiops), were investigated with respect to immunological mechanisms.\n The functional immune response of monkeys to infection was similar (though not identical) to that of humans to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).\n In the sera of infected animals, neutralizing antibodies were found to be low or absent, and in particular there was no neutralization of the various isolates by homologous sera.\n There was no detectable antibody/complement cytotoxicity, though AGM sera were able to initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis of infected cells in the presence of healthy effector peripheral blood lymphocytes.\n As in the human/HIV system, macrophages from AGMs are readily infected by SIVagm.\n Two possibly important differences between the AGM/SIVagm system and the human/HIV system are (i) the low immune response of the AGMs to the core protein of SIVagm and (ii) the significantly lower inhibitory effect of SIVagm proteins on the proliferation of AGM lymphocytes.",
