  "text": "Chronic Lyme disease with an expansive granulomatous lesion in the cerebellopontine angle.\n Expansive granulomatous lesions in the posterior cranial fossa are rare and have not been reported in conjunction with Lyme disease.\n We report a patient with verified Borrelia burgdorferi infection who developed a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle.\n Rapid growth of the tumor led to signs of cerebral compression and to hydrocephalus.\n Surgical intervention was required despite florid meningitis.\n The histological examination showed inflammatory, nonspecific granulation tissue.\n The origin of this tissue is almost certainly causally related to the B.\n burgdorferi infection.\n Signs of inflammation resolved rapidly after subtotal resection.\n The clinical, radiological, and biochemical course is documented.\n This is the first report of an expansive cerebral lesion in the chronic phase of Lyme disease.",
