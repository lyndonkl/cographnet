  "text": "Treating systemic fungal infections in AIDS patients. Prolonging life against the odds.\n Fungal infections have become one of the major causes of death among immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS.\n Accurate and quick diagnosis is difficult; therefore, empirical therapy is often necessary.\n This scenario is complicated by the fact that most antifungal agents are toxic at the doses used or relatively ineffective against deep-seated mycoses.\n Because the population of AIDS patients is increasing, physicians will be faced more often with the management of systemic fungal infections.\n Despite the current bleak prognosis for these patients, several new antigen detection tests are being developed and triazole agents are proving to be effective and less toxic than their predecessors.\n Many cases of systemic mycoses do result in mortality, but appropriate treatment can both prolong life and improve its quality.",
