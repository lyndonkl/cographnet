  "text": "Tracheostomy in children with Guillain Barre syndrome \n During the 10-yr period beginning January 1979, 59 infants and children with Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) were admitted to our hospital.\n Tracheostomies were performed in 15 patients and their records were reviewed.\n Fourteen patients were recalled for assessment of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength (RMS).\n The median duration of assisted ventilation (including endotracheal [ET] intubation) was 21 days and the median duration of tracheostomy was 39 days.\n Only two patients were discharged with the tracheostomy in situ.\n All patients were successfully decannulated at the first attempt.\n No tracheostomy-related complications or symptoms were reported apart from croup in two patients.\n On review, lung volumes and maximal inspiratory and expiratory flows were normal.\n There was no evidence of tracheal stenosis or significant tracheomalacia.\n RMS tests were normal.\n In this hospital, tracheostomy is a safe, well-tolerated procedure in the management of infants and children with GBS who need long-term ventilation.\n There were no deaths and all patients returned to their normal school or were gainfully employed after their illness, although 12 patients had mild persistent weakness of at least foot dorsiflexion.",
