  "text": "Measles in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza: continuing incidence and the case for a new eradication strategy.\n Measles continues to occur in epidemic waves in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank, causing morbidity and mortality.\n In Israel, immunization of infants against measles began in 1967, and 90% had been immunized by the mid-1980s.\n In Gaza and the West Bank, where immunization of infants against measles began in 1973 and 1976, respectively, the immunization rate reached 75% in the late 1970s and increased to greater than 90% in the 1980s.\n Measles epidemics, which previously had occurred in 5- to 7-year cycles, occurred every 2-4 years in the 1980s and affected individuals who were older than those affected in previous years.\n Israel's commitment to eradicating measles by 1992 will require a substantially expanded immunization program in comparison with the traditional program that requires immunization of infants alone.\n The benefits of several alternative immunization strategies considerably exceed their costs.\n A new, two-dose immunization will be needed as a minimal strategy, and a campaign for administering booster doses to school-aged children may be required as well to achieve control and eradication of measles.\n Measles is a serious but preventable public health problem; appropriate strategies must be devised by national and international public health officials to control the disease in developing and developed countries.",
