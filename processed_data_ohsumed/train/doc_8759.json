  "text": "Extending intramedullary rods in congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia.\n Five patients with Boyd type II congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia underwent excision of the pseudarthrosis and double onlay bone grafting.\n Stability was maintained by extending intramedullary rods.\n Clinical union was achieved in all cases at a mean of 8.6 months (range six to 11).\n The rods extended by 15.7% (range 2% to 31.4%) as growth occurred.\n One rod was removed because of infection and a vascularised free fibular graft was subsequently performed.\n The extending rods provided stability while union occurred and did not require revision as the legs grew.\n The rods can be removed easily and have not jeopardized further surgical options.",
