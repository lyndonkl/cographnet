  "text": "Brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene fistulas for hemodialysis.\n A retrospective analysis was made of 16 patients who had received a brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft for hemodialysis.\n In four patients, the procedure was used to treat malfunctioning brachio-axillary fistulas due to long venous stenosis in the axillary vein.\n In 12 other patients, the operation was chosen in cases of exhaustion of the veins in the upper extremity because of previous multiple failed fistulas.\n Two patients died with a functioning fistula 7 and 10 months after placement of the graft of causes unrelated to the vascular access.\n The other 14 patients retained functioning fistulas between 8 and 26 months after construction of the shunt.\n Three patients needed graft thrombectomy to treat occlusive episodes.\n No venous stenosis was found in a postoperative fistulography made in those patients.\n One patient needed substitution of a graft segment due to stenosis of the prosthesis crossing over the clavicle.\n We believe that the brachial-jugular graft is a procedure that can be considered as vascular access for hemodialysis in cases where the use of veins in the upper extremity and the axilla is not possible.",
