  "text": "Serum and urinary beta-hexosaminidase as markers of heavy drinking.\n Serum and urinary beta-hexosaminidase (SHEX and UHEX) were determined in 32 alcoholic men admitted to inpatient detoxification treatment for seven days, and in 27 teetotallers.\n On the admission SHEX was increased in 68.8% and UHEX in 81.3% and after seven days of abstinence the corresponding percentages were 37.5 (SHEX) and 71.9 (UHEX).\n During the treatment SHEX decreased significantly while UHEX did not.\n On the admission to the treatment UHEX correlated positively with SHEX (r = 0.54; P less than 0.01).\n The results suggest that UHEX may be a more sensitive marker of heavy drinking than SHEX.\n Furthermore UHEX stays longer elevated than SHEX.",
