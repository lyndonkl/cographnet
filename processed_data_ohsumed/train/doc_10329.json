  "text": "Angle-closure glaucoma as initial presentation of myelodysplastic syndrome.\n A 57-year-old man presented with proptosis of the right eye and findings consistent with bilateral angle-closure glaucoma.\n Subsequent evaluation revealed severe bilateral uveal effusions and associated nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachments, which were felt to be related to orbital pseudotumour and associated scleritis.\n Hematologic studies were consistent with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome.\n Although myelodysplastic syndrome has been reported in one patient with orbital inflammation and myositis, to our knowledge ciliochoroidal effusion and secondary angle closure have not previously been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome.",
