  "text": "Time-course of alterations of bladder function following acetone-induced cystitis.\n Although chemical cystitis is known clinically to cause decreased bladder function, there are few experimental studies on the progression of, and recovery from chemical cystitis.\n Mature male rabbits underwent intravesical instillation of 50% acetone solution through a urethral catheter.\n Micturition profiles showed a marked decrease of the mean and maximal micturition volume and an increase in number of micturitions as early as one day after treatment.\n The micturition profile gradually normalized between four and eight weeks after instillation.\n In vivo cystometry showed a very small bladder capacity and low compliance during the first week following instillation, and gradually recovered to control levels by four weeks.\n Functional studies using the in vitro whole bladder model showed a significant decrease in the ability of the bladder to generate pressure and to empty at three days after instillation.\n These parameters recovered partially by two weeks, and completely by four weeks.\n Chemical cystitis induced by intravesical acetone instillation resulted in a severe decrease in the bladder function, i.e.\n contracted bladder with low compliance and poor ability to generate pressure and empty.\n However, these changes were reversible within the two month period of study.",
