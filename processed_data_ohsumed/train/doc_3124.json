  "text": "Endometriosis of the abdominal wall.\n Endometriosis of the abdominal wall typically occurs as a painful mass in a lower abdominal incision from previous cesarean section or hysterectomy.\n Most patients are young and in their active reproductive years.\n The histologic diagnosis requires a combination of either endometrial-like glands, endometrial stroma, or hemosiderin pigment.\n The diagnosis must be considered in any woman with an abdominal wall mass and a history of transabdominal gynecologic surgery.\n Wide excision offers the best chance to prevent recurrence.",
