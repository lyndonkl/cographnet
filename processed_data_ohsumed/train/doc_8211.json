  "text": "Cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis evolving into total lipodystrophy.\n A 15-year-old boy had persistent fever with severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorder, and marked elevation of lactate dehydrogenase values.\n A diagnosis of cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis was made after repeated skin biopsies.\n Three years after onset, he gradually lost 20 kg in body weight, and both skin and bone marrow specimens revealed degenerative changes of fatty tissue without any inflammatory cells.\n These findings suggest that total lipodystrophy syndrome results from the inflammatory destructive process of adipose tissue.\n To our knowledge, our report is the first to show, in a series of histologic studies, that an inflammatory destructive process may be involved in some cases of total lipodystrophy syndrome.",
