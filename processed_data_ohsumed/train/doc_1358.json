  "text": "In vitro evaluation of nicotinamide riboside analogs against Haemophilus influenzae.\n Exogenous NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside is required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae.\n These compounds have been defined as the V-factor growth requirement.\n We have previously shown that the internalization of nicotinamide riboside is energy dependent and carrier mediated with saturation kinetics.\n Thionicotinamide riboside, 3-pyridinealdehyde riboside, 3-acetylpyridine riboside, and 3-aminopyridine riboside were prepared from their corresponding NAD analogs.\n These compounds and several other nicotinamide riboside analogs were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of H.\n influenzae and for their ability to block the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside by H.\n influenzae.\n 3-Aminopyridine riboside blocked the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside and inhibited the growth of H.\n influenzae when NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside served as the V factor.\n The antibacterial activity of 3-aminopyridine riboside was found to be specific for H.\n influenzae but had no effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli.\n In additional experiments by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that whole cells of H.\n influenzae degrade 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to 3-aminopyridine riboside, which is then internalized.\n Inside the cell, 3-aminopyridine riboside has the ability to interfere with the growth of H.\n influenzae by an undetermined mechanism.",
