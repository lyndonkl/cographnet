  "text": "Brief intervention strategies for harmful drinkers: new directions for medical education.\n Recent advances in the technology of behavioural interventions for harmful drinkers have created a new role for clinical practice and new challenges for medical education.\n Several reports from expert committees have recommended new initiatives in the secondary prevention of alcohol problems through physician-based interventions at the primary care level.\n The conceptual and scientific bases for these recommendations are discussed in terms of recent studies of harmful and hazardous drinkers.\n The behavioural principles thought to account for the effectiveness of brief interventions are explained.\n Despite these promising developments, difficulties are inherent in the introduction of new technologies, especially behavioural technologies, into medical practice.\n A major challenge to medical education will be the development of academic programs that not only teach skills and competencies in secondary prevention but also deal with the socialization of physicians as behavioural practitioners.",
