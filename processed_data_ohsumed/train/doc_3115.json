  "text": "Effects of intravascular fetal blood transfusion on fetal intracardiac Doppler velocity waveforms.\n In 12 fetuses from pregnancies with red blood cell isoimmunization Doppler velocity waveforms were recorded at the level of atrioventricular valves immediately before and at 15-minute intervals for 2 hours after the intravascular transfusion.\n The left and right cardiac outputs, the ratio between the peak velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active atrial filling at the level of both ventricles as well as the heart rate were calculated.\n Before transfusion, the left and right cardiac outputs were significantly higher than reference ranges for gestation that were constructed from the cross-sectional study of 187 normal pregnancies.\n After transfusion there was a significant temporary fall in right and left outputs associated with increased ratios between the peak velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active atrial filling.\n Within 2 hours after transfusion both parameters returned toward the normal range.\n In addition, no significant changes were found for fetal heart rate values before and after transfusion.\n The fall of cardiac output was significantly related to the amount of expansion of the feto-placental volume.",
