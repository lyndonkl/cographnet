  "text": "A new DNA marker (D10S94) very tightly linked to the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) locus.\n Combined somatic cell hybrid and linkage studies between D10S94 and five pericentromeric loci (FNRB, D10Z1, MEN2A, RBP3, and D10S15) have localized the new DNA sequence pcl1/A1S-6-c23 at D10S94 to 10q11.2.\n No recombinants were observed between D10S94 and D10Z1 or MEN2A.\n D10S94 maps in proximal 10q11.2 very near to MEN2A.\n There are three possible orders for the six loci that we investigated from the centromeric region of chromosome 10.\n At present the genetic data do not allow us to order MEN2A with respect to D10Z1 and D10S94.\n The three possible orders are FNRB-D10Z1-D10S94-MEN2A-RBP3-D10S15, FNRB-D10Z1-MEN2A-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15, and FNRB-MEN2A-D10Z1-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15.\n In view of the fact that no recombinants between D10S94 and MEN2A or between D10S94 and D10Z1 were observed, the combined haplotypes formed from RFLPs and D10Z1 and D10S94 will increase the informativeness and accuracy of genotype prediction for at-risk members of the families having the MEN 2A syndrome, particularly when the affected parent is female.\n The localization of D10S94 with respect to MEN2A will prove valuable in experiments directed toward cloning the MEN2A locus.",
