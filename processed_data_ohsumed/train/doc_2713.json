  "text": "Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature.\n Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis.\n The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear.\n This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system.\n The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns.\n Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information.\n In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.",
