  "text": "Nylon suture toxicity after vitrectomy surgery.\n A patient underwent an uneventful pars plana vitrectomy with superior sclerotomies closed with 8-0 nylon suture.\n Four months later, the patient had a suture reaction presumably related to allergy to the suture itself.\n The signs and symptoms resolved after removal of the suture.\n Although similar cases have been reported after nylon sutures in cataract wound closure, this is the first reported occurrence of this phenomenon in vitrectomy surgery to our knowledge.",
