  "text": "Treatment of infants with neurogenic bladder dysfunction using anticholinergic drugs and intermittent catheterisation.\n The use of anticholinergic drugs in infants with neurogenic dysfunction has not been well documented.\n In this study, 35 neonates at risk of upper urinary tract damage from neurogenic dysfunction were treated from infancy with anticholinergics, in combination with clean intermittent catheterisation.\n None of the patients showed upper urinary tract deterioration with follow-up ranging from 6 to 72 months, although 2 required vesicostomy--1 due to difficulty with catheterisation and 1 due to possible anticholinergic side effects.\n Only 2 (6%) have had clinical pyelonephritis.\n Twenty-five (76%) are virtually dry between catheterisation.\n We conclude that anticholinergics are safe and effective, even in the neonatal period, when used in combination with clean intermittent catheterisation for the treatment of neonates with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.",
