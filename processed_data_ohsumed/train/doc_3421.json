  "text": "Palliative operations for colorectal cancer.\n A review of 96 consecutive patients who underwent palliative surgery for primary colorectal cancer was undertaken to clarify the value of palliation achieved with surgical treatment.\n The overall rate of postoperative mortality was 8 percent (8 of 96) and the overall rate of postoperative morbidity was 24 percent (23 of 96).\n The mortality rate was 5 percent (3 of 66) after resective surgery and 17 percent (5 of 30) after nonresective surgery.\n Three deaths were related to the malignant disease, three were related to the intra-abdominal infection, and two were related to formation of intestinocutaneous fistulas.\n Of the 8 patients who died, 1 had a tumor with local visceral involvement only and 7 had a tumor with more distant spread.\n Median survival was 10 months for all patients, 15 months for patients treated with resective surgery, and 7 months for nonresected patients.\n Five patients (5 percent) have survived for longer than 5 years.\n The median relief of preoperative cancer symptoms was 4 months (4 months after resective surgery and 1 month after nonresective surgery).\n Twenty-five patients have undergone second surgery.\n It is concluded that palliative resective surgery for colorectal cancer can improve patient comfort with an acceptable postoperative mortality rate when cancer growth is localized and in favorable cases with more distant spread, whereas nonresective surgery fails to achieve symptom relief.",
