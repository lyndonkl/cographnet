  "text": "Cross-sectional radiography for implant site assessment.\n An accurate tomographic technique is described for acquisition of optimal cross-sectional images of implant sites before implant surgery.\n The described technique is applicable to tomographic systems equipped with a cephalometric head positioner.\n This cross-sectional tomographic technique was performed on a series of patients and the images of the first 20 patients subsequently evaluated.\n The cross-sectional images allowed for the characterization of the alveolar crest and visualization of anatomic structures in a buccolingual dimension while providing an accurate estimation of available vertical space from the crest.",
