  "text": "Acquired retinal arteriovenous communications in occlusive disease of the carotid artery.\n Retinal arteriovenous communications proximal to extensive areas of complete vascular closure developed in three patients with occlusive disease of the carotid arteries.\n In one case, the authors document the development of the arteriovenous communications through successive enlargement of small retinal vessels after progressive signs of retinal ischemia in the form of narrowed retinal arteries, venous dilation and beading, microaneurysms, retinal dot and blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and capillary nonperfusion.\n The development of arteriovenous communications in carotid occlusive disease has not been described previously.",
