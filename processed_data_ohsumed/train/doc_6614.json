  "text": "Extended neck dissection.\n From the time Crile described radical neck dissection in 1906, this surgical procedure became popular in the management of metastatic cancer in the neck.\n Over the past two decades, the modified neck dissection has been effectively utilized for conservation of function and cosmesis while achieving the same oncologic goals.\n However, there are several instances where the above standard procedures are not adequate for resection of malignant tumors.\n Although there is a definite trend toward conservation procedures, extended neck dissection is often necessary especially in patients with N2 and N3 disease.\n Apart from the standard structures removed in radical neck dissection, the other structures removed in extended neck dissection include skin, the digastric muscle, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, sympathetic chain, ramus mandibularis, carotid artery, tracheo-esophageal nodes, etc.\n Over the past seven years, we have performed 40 extended neck dissections.\n All the patients had N2 or N3 disease in the neck.\n Nine patients had unknown primaries.\n Thirteen patients had their primary tumors in the oral cavity and 11 in the laryngopharynx.\n Five patients had primary tumor in the salivary glands and two patients had metastatic melanoma.\n Patients who underwent extensive skin excision had pectoralis myocutaneous flap reconstruction.\n All patients received postoperative radiation therapy.\n One patient died of cardiac problems 4 weeks after operation.\n Local control was achieved in 70%.\n The most difficult region for local control was the disease behind the mastoid process, and the most difficult problems were patients with involvement of the subdermal lymphatics.\n Our data suggests that there are definite situations where extended neck dissection is indicated with satisfactory local control of the nodal disease.",
