  "text": "Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Reoperation for pouch-related complications.\n The aim was to assess the value of reoperative surgery for pouch-related complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis.\n Between January 1981 and August 1989, 114 of 982 IPAA patients (12%) seen at the Mayo Clinic had complications directly related to IPAA that required reoperation.\n Among the 114 patients, the complications prevented initial ileostomy closure in 33 patients (25%), occurred after ileostomy closure in 68 patients (60%), and delayed ileostomy closure in the remaining patients.\n The salvage procedures performed included anal dilatation under anesthesia for anastomotic strictures, placement of setons and/or fistulotomy for perianal fistulae, unroofing of anastomotic sinuses, simple drainage and antibiotics for perianal abscesses, abdominal exploration with drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with or without establishment of ileostomy, and complete or partial reconstruction of the reservoir for patients with inadequate emptying.\n None of the reoperated patients died.\n Reoperation led to restoration of pouch function in two thirds of patients and, of these, 70% had an excellent clinical outcome.\n However approximately 20% of the 114 pouches required excision.\n Excision was common, especially among patients who had pelvic sepsis.\n Salvage procedures for pouch-specific complications can be done safely and will restore pouch function in two thirds of patients.\n Complications after reoperation, however, may ultimately lead to loss of the reservoir in one in five patients.",
