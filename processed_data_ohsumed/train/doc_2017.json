  "text": "Valvular and coronary surgery in renal transplant patients.\n The Authors report aortic valvular replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) successfully performed in two renal transplant patients.\n The postoperative blood urea and creatinine levels were comparable to the preoperative values.\n The first patient underwent isolated AVR.\n The second patient had an initial AVR combined with CABG followed two years later by a further AVR for prosthetic dysfunction.\n For many reasons, coronary artery (CAD) and valvular diseases are not uncommon in renal transplant patients.\n Cardiac surgery is feasible without impairment of the renal function provided some precautions are taken, ie good mean perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), adequate volume replacement, and selected use of mannitol and dopamine.",
