  "text": "Physiologic and pathologic alterations associated with ultrasonically generated shock waves.\n Kidneys of 25 dogs were treated with ultrasonic shock waves and examined for both physiologic and pathologic changes.\n The number of pulses ranged from 2,000 to 8,000.\n The rate of the shock waves varied from one to 20 pulses per second.\n The difference in pulse rate did not affect the changes seen either acutely or in the delayed examination of the kidneys during the repair process.\n The physiologic and pathologic changes which occurred involved the renal tubule to a greater degree than the glomerulus.\n These alterations were resolving by one week following exposure to the shock waves.",
