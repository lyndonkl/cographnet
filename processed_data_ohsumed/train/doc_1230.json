  "text": "Epidemiology of Lyme disease in Virginia.\n Prior to January 1986, only one case of Lyme disease was reported from Virginia.\n In 1986-87, however, the Virginia Department of Health observed an increase in reports of suspected Lyme disease by physicians, despite the fact that Ixodes dammini is not highly prevalent in the Virginia tick population.\n Twenty-eight cases of Lyme disease were identified in Virginia, of which eight cases occurred in 1986 and 20 in 1987.\n Lyme disease appears to be increasing in frequency in Virginia and moving southward along the Eastern Atlantic Seaboard.",
