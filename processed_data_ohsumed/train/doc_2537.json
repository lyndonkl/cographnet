  "text": "Clinical experience with the Medtronic-Hall valve prosthesis.\n Medtronic-Hall valves were implanted during 204 procedures performed between 1982 and 1988.\n Mean population age was 54.4 years; 96% of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or greater.\n Emergency operations constituted 16% of the procedures.\n Rheumatic heart disease was the single most common indication for valve replacement.\n In 18% of patients, operation was performed to replace a previous prosthetic valve.\n The mean follow-up was 3.2 years.\n Overall operative mortality was 10.3%, the highest mortality being for double-valve replacements (24%).\n Valve-related mortality, by position, was 5.3% for aortic valves, 6.0% for mitral valves, and 4.0% for multiple-valve replacements.\n Actuarial 5-year freedom from events were: survival, 68%; thromboembolism, 90%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 98%; paravalvular leak, 95%; and reoperation, 92%.\n Complications with the highest mortality were thromboembolism (36%) and endocarditis (33%).\n The complication rates in this series are high but the patients were more severely ill than in other reports, and operative survivors experienced a considerable improvement in New York Heart Association functional class.",
