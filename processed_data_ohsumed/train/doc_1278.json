  "text": "Spectrum of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in 68 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.\n Sixty-eight patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Cryptococcus neoformans who presented to three major medical centers in New Orleans, Louisiana, were studied retrospectively.\n In patients with meningitis the most common presenting symptoms were fever and headache.\n Those without central nervous system involvement generally had an isolated pulmonary infection due to C.\n neoformans and presented with cough and dyspnea.\n CSF parameters were abnormal in 41% of patients, and the India ink preparation was positive in 88% of patients with cultures of CSF positive for C.\n neoformans.\n The overall median survival time for the 47 patients who died was 5 months, with a range of 0-22 months.\n Of the 27 patients who received maintenance therapy with amphotericin B, two (7%) relapsed.\n The only factors found to be associated with a poor prognosis were abnormal computed tomography of the head and altered mental status on presentation.\n C.\n neoformans infections in HIV-infected patients remain difficult to treat and have a poor prognosis.",
