  "text": "Bacterial tracheitis: report of eight new cases and review.\n Bacterial tracheitis, previously referred to as nondiphtheritic laryngitis with marked exudate, was commonly discussed in pediatric textbooks before 1940.\n It seemed to disappear as a clinical entity after that time, but it has been recorded with increasing frequency in the pediatric literature since 1979.\n We describe eight new cases and review 110 previously described cases.\n The clinical course consists of a prodromal upper respiratory illness with stridor, fever, and a variable degree of respiratory distress.\n Unlike patients with croup, patients with bacterial tracheitis do not respond to aerosolized racemic epinephrine.\n Most patients require endotracheal intubation; some require tracheostomy.\n Reported complications include pneumonia, pneumothorax, formation of pseudomembranes, toxic shock syndrome, and cardiopulmonary arrest.\n Bacterial tracheitis is a secondary bacterial infection following a primary viral respiratory infection.\n The most common preceding viral infection is parainfluenza.\n Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are the predominant causes of bacterial tracheitis.\n Secondary bacterial infection may occur as a result of tracheal mucosal injury or impairment of normal phagocytic function due to viral infection.",
