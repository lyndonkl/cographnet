  "text": "True hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, 46,XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy.\n The first case (to the authors' knowledge) is reported of a true hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, a 46, XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy.\n The true hermaphroditism was diagnosed during infancy.\n The patient was subsequently found to have a gonadoblastoma and a microscopic dysgerminoma in the gonad diagnosed as an ovotestis and excised during infancy.\n The successful pregnancy occurred when the patient was 29 years old.\n A year later a large gonadal tumor affecting the remaining gonad was excised.\n The gonad was found to be an ovotestis, and the tumor was a dysgerminoma arising from a gonadoblastoma.\n This case further emphasizes the malignant potential of the Y chromosome in patients with abnormal gonads.",
