  "text": "Effects of converting-enzyme inhibition on barrier function in diabetic glomerulopathy.\n Differential solute clearances were used to examine the effects of a 90-day course of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 16 proteinuric patients with diabetic glomerulopathy.\n By day 90, plasma renin and prorenin became elevated, and arterial pressure declined.\n Transglomerular passage of dextrans of broad size distribution (radii 28-60 A) was lowered significantly.\n In a subset of 8 patients, withdrawal of enalapril was followed after an additional 30 days by a return of renin levels and arterial pressure to pretreatment levels.\n The dextran-sieving profile also returned to baseline, becoming uniformly elevated above treated day-90 levels.\n A theoretical analysis of the serial dextran-sieving profiles indicated that enalapril shifted glomerular pore size distribution to smaller size.\n These changes in barrier size selectivity were associated with a reduction in fractional albumin and IgG clearances during enalapril therapy and a subsequent rise in these quantities after its withdrawal; urinary protein excretion rate tended to vary in parallel.\n We conclude that inhibition of converting enzyme in humans with established diabetic glomerulopathy diminishes glomerular permeability to proteins by enhancing barrier size selectivity.\n Because neither enalapril therapy nor its withdrawal influenced the glomerular filtration or renal plasma flow rates significantly, we propose that the primary action of enalapril may be to modulate the intrinsic membrane properties of the glomerular barrier.",
