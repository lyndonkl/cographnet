  "text": "Visual results and complications of transsclerally sutured intraocular lenses in penetrating keratoplasty.\n We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 56 consecutive patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty with transscleral fixation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.\n Follow-up ranged from 3 to 28 months (mean, 11.1 months).\n Postoperative visual acuity improved in 46 patients (82%), remained the same in eight (14%), and worsened in two (3.6%).\n In 32 patients with at least 10 months' follow-up, best corrected visual acuity as measured with a pinhole or hard contact lens was 20/40 or better in 12 (38%), 20/50 to 20/10 in 10 (31%), and 20/200 or worse in 10 (31%).\n Problems with lens decentration, tilt, or scleral suture-related infections were minimal.\n Glaucoma was the msot common cause of decreased vision in patients with 10 or more months' follow-up.\n Three patients (5.4%) developed rhegmatogenous retinal detachments early in the postoperative course.",
