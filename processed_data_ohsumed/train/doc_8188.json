  "text": "Cyclosporine and chronic sarcoidosis.\n Two patients with progressive sarcoidosis who had poor responses and side effects from corticosteroid therapy were treated with cyclosporine.\n Cyclosporine suppressed conventional markers of inflammation and there was clinical improvement in one patient, but the disease recurred when therapy was discontinued.\n The second patient who had diabetes mellitus developed unstable glucose metabolism when given cyclosporine.\n This unstable diabetes mellitus together with side effects of nausea and vomiting resulted in weight loss and inadequate serum therapeutic levels that was associated with a poor therapeutic response to the cyclosporine.\n The major side effects in both patients were headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, but there was no renal dysfunction.\n We conclude that while corticosteroids remain the mainstay of sarcoid therapy, when these drugs have not been successful for the skin manifestations of the disease, a trial of cyclosporine may be justified.",
