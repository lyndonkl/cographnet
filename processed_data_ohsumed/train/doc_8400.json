  "text": "Anaesthetic management of systemic mastocytosis.\n Systemic mastocytosis is an uncommon disorder of mast cell proliferation in connective tissues.\n Mast cell degranulation may occur on exposure to various stimuli and drugs.\n The release of histamine, heparin and vasoactive substances such as prostaglandin D2 may cause severe hypotension and other anaphylactoid manifestations.\n Anaesthetic management should include perioperative stabilization of mast cells and avoidance of the use of histamine-releasing drugs.\n Intradermal skin testing is useful in predicting the sensitivity to drugs that may be used during anaesthesia.\n We present a patient with systemic mastocytosis who underwent uneventful cholecystectomy.",
