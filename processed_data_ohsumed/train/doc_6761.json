  "text": "Neonatal intracranial choriocarcinoma.\n A 1-month-old infant died from extensive intracerebral hemorrhage due to a metastatic choriocarcinoma to the brain that presumably originated in the placenta.\n The clinical course was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, repeated episodes of seizures, and intracranial hemorrhage.\n A computed tomographic scan revealed a large vascular mass in the left parieto-occipital region and a small lesion in the left frontal lobe.\n The placenta was expelled during the delivery and was not examined.\n In view of the high level of maternal human chorionic gonadotropic hormone and the autopsy finding of metastasis, we presumed that the mass was a metastatic choriocarcinoma that had originated in the maternal placenta.\n To our knowledge, only one previous instance of this phenomenon has been reported.",
