  "text": "HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\n We compared human major histocompatibility (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with that on normal mucosa.\n Frozen sections of a consecutive series of 30 squamous cell carcinomas were stained with the monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (class I) and anti-DR (class II) using an immunoperoxidase technique.\n Normal mucosa showed class I and class II expression in the basal layers only.\n Class I expression on tumors was diffuse in 87%, patchy in 10%, and scattered in 3%.\n Class II expression on tumors was diffuse in 20%, patchy in 53%, scattered in 20%, and absent in 7%.\n Patterns of expression did not correlate significantly with clinical parameters, including survival, except that class II diffuse and patchy patterns were found to correlate with more poorly differentiated tumors.",
