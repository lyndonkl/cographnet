  "text": "Radiographic appearances in lumbar disc prolapse.\n The pre-operative lumbar spine radiographs of 200 consecutive patients who had undergone discectomy for prolapsed intervertebral disc were reviewed.\n Prolapse was recognized as bulging or sequestration of the disc with consequent root compromise.\n Measurement of the lumbar level of the interiliac line was shown to correlate with the level of disc prolapse and the incidence of transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral junction was significantly higher than normal.\n A pathological value for the lumbosacral angle could not be identified.",
