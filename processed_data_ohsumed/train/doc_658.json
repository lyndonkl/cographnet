  "text": "Clinical significance of cholelithiasis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\n There is general agreement that the prevalence of gallstones in cirrhotics is high (at least twice that in the general population), but the pathogenetic link between cirrhosis and cholelithiasis is still uncertain.\n The influence of cholelithiasis on survival in cirrhotics is also unknown.\n During an 8-year period, we observed 90 patients affected by decompensated cirrhosis: 36 of them (40%) turned out by cholecystographic/cholangiographic or ultrasonographic examination to have cholelithiasis.\n We were not able to demonstrate any correlation between cholelithiasis and sex, age of patients, etiology of cirrhosis, severity of the illness, degree of portal hypertension, previous gastrointestinal bleeding, number of pregnancies, or levels of serum cholesterol, bilirubin, and triglycerides.\n During the follow-up observation, (range, 1-91 months), 30 patients died.\n Survival curves analyzed by the log-rank test did not show any difference between patients with or without gallstones.\n We therefore confirm that cirrhosis is a lithogenic condition, but we were not able to explain the reasons for the close relationship between cholelithiasis and cirrhosis.\n Gallstones, however, did not affect the survival of these patients.",
