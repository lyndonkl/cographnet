  "text": "Late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease.\n Krabbe's disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by a lack of galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase activity.\n In contrast to the classic early infantile-onset form of Krabbe's disease, less recognized, late-onset variants exist.\n The authors present a case of late juvenile-onset Krabbe's disease, including the associated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.\n Most patients with late-onset Krabbe's disease present with visual loss due to optic atrophy.\n Associated gait abnormalities and parental consanguinity should increase the clinician's suspicion that a child may have late-onset Krabbe's disease.\n Because of the prolonged survival in late-onset Krabbe's disease, the recent development of bone marrow transplantation for these patient makes diagnosis of this disorder particularly important.",
