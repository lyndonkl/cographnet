  "text": "Sequential gradient pneumatic compression enhances venous ulcer healing: a randomized trial.\n The treatment of venous ulcers has remained largely unchanged for centuries.\n The application of properly applied graduated compression bandages, the use of graduated compression stockings, and surgery have been shown to achieve healing.\n However, some ulcers persist despite appropriate management.\n A randomized study was undertaken to compare two regimens of treatment for such patients.\n Both regimens included ulcer debridement, cleaning, nonadherent dressing, and graduated compression stockings.\n In one regimen, sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression was applied for 4 hours each day.\n Only one of 24 patients in the control group had complete healing of all ulcers compared with 10 of 21 patients healed in the intermittent pneumatic compression group.\n The median rate of ulcer healing in the control group was 2.1% area per week compared to 19.8% area per week in the intermittent pneumatic compression group.\n The results indicate that sequential gradient intermittent pneumatic compression is beneficial in the treatment of venous ulcers.",
