  "text": "Thoracoplasty: current application to the infected pleural space \n Thoracoplasty, once commonly used in the management of cavitary pulmonary disease, continues to find application in the obliteration of infected pleural spaces.\n This study reports a series of 13 patients receiving thoracoplasty between 1976 and 1989.\n Five patients had chronic apical empyema spaces without prior resection of lung tissue.\n Two of the empyemas were due to tuberculosis, two were due to atypical mycobacteria, and one was due to postpneumonic empyema.\n All patients had extensive destruction of upper lobe tissue.\n Eight patients had undergone prior pulmonary resection; 3 had persistent infected spaces in the early postoperative period, 3 had development of empyemas and bronchopleural fistulas late (5 to 19 years) after pulmonary resection, and 2 had postpneumonectomy empyema.\n All patients had rigid cavity walls preventing space obliteration by rib removal alone and required concomitant resection of the thickened pleura and intercostal muscle tissues.\n Bronchopleural fistulas were present in 11 patients and were closed with adjacent nonintercostal muscle.\n All patients survived and had successful obliteration of the infected spaces with acceptable physiological and cosmetic results.\n We conclude that thoracoplasty remains a useful procedure in the management of the infected pleural space in select patients.",
