  "text": "Immunoglobulin G subclasses in serum and circulating immune complexes in patients with Kawasaki syndrome.\n IgG subclass concentrations in sera of 17 patients with Kawasaki syndrome were determined.\n Significantly increased IgG1 (P less than 0.001) and IgG3 (P less than 0.001) were found in the patients compared with 22 age-matched healthy children, whereas IgG2 and IgG4 were normal or slightly decreased.\n IgG immune complexes were measured by protein A-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) combined polyethylene glycol precipitations.\n Eight of 17 patients (47.1%) were found to have circulating immune complexes (CIC) values above the normal control range (geometric mean +2 SD).\n IgG subclass composition in CIC was analyzed.\n The subclasses in CIC were predominantly IgG1 and IgG3.\n Because the antibody responses to different antigens exhibit IgG subclass restriction, it would suggest that the change of serum and CIC IgG subclasses in Kawasaki syndrome may have relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease.",
