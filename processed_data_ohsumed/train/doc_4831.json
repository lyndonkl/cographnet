  "text": "Developmental dysmnesia in a poor reader.\n A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory from an early age.\n In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of the year.\n His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times.\n A battery of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, whereas spatial memory was preserved.\n Other cognitive functions were intact, except for a mild reading disability.\n No evidence of brain pathology was provided by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning.",
