  "text": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha plays a role in host defense against Histoplasma capsulatum.\n Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was detected in supernatants collected from BALB/c mouse peritoneal macrophages incubated continuously with Histoplasma capsulatum.\n The levels of TNF alpha measured by actinomycin D bioassay peaked within hours after exposure and then greatly declined by 24 h.\n TNF alpha was also measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from BALB/c mice challenged intranasally with H.\n capsulatum.\n Lavage fluid TNF alpha levels exhibited the same pattern as the in vitro supernatants; they peaked within hours after challenge and lower levels were detected at 24 h.\n Treatment of mice with anti-TNF alpha antibody accelerated mortality in response to systemic infection and significantly increased tissue colony counts in the liver and spleen.\n In the murine model, TNF alpha is produced in response to H.\n capsulatum and appears to play some role in host defense to infection.",
