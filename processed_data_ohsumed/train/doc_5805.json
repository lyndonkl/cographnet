  "text": "Occult fatal pulmonary embolism with disseminated intravascular coagulation. An unusual case masquerading as miliary tuberculosis.\n We report a fatal case of occult pulmonary embolism complicating bronchogenic carcinoma which presented with rapidly progressive pulmonary miliary shadows and respiratory failure.\n A clotting profile abnormality compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation was noted.\n Postmortem examination showed extensive clots occluding the major pulmonary vessels and areas of pulmonary infarcts.\n Histologic examination revealed fibrin deposition in the microvasculature compatible with DIC.\n Cases of pulmonary embolism with DIC have previously been reported, but this is the first case with pathologic confirmation.\n Thus, unusual presentation with diffuse lung shadow and DIC should not deter the clinician from correct diagnosis so that appropriate treatment can be promptly started.",
