  "text": "Effects of 4-methylpyrazole, methanol/ethylene glycol antidote, in healthy humans.\n 4-Methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, may be useful for the treatment of methanol and ethylene glycol intoxications.\n A placebo-controlled, double blind, multiple dose, sequential, ascending-dose study has been performed to determine the tolerance of 4-MP in healthy volunteers.\n Oral loading doses of 4-MP were followed by supplemental doses every 12 h through 5 days, producing plasma levels in the therapeutic range.\n A slight, transient elevation in one or both serum transaminase values was observed in 6 of the 15 subjects treated with 4-MP.\n This effect was not dose related nor apparently mediated through a hypersensitivity reaction.\n Serum triglyceride levels were increased in 30% of 4-MP treated subjects, but also in 25% of the placebo subjects.\n 4-MP treatment did not produce any other significant changes in objective clinical parameters nor in subjective side effects.\n The results suggest that a mild, transient increase in liver function tests might be observed in some subjects treated with multiple doses of 4-MP.\n Nevertheless, the slower elimination rate and lesser degree of toxicity of 4-MP would make it preferable to ethanol in therapy of these poisonings.",
