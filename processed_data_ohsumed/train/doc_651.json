  "text": "Gastric outlet obstruction caused by traumatic pseudoaneurysm of superior mesenteric artery.\n Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are extremely rare.\n We describe two cases of posttraumatic proximal SMA pseudoaneurysms with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction.\n Repair was accomplished by aorta-SMA bypass with saphenous vein.\n Injuries to the proximal SMA are easily missed at laparotomy, especially if intestinal ischemia or hematomas are absent.\n Recognition and repair are stressed to avoid the complications associated with pseudoaneurysm formation.",
