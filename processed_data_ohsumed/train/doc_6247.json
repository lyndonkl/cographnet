  "text": "Histologic, biochemical, and ion analysis of tissue and fluids retrieved during total hip arthroplasty.\n Large amounts of metal and polyethylene debris and high ion readings are found in capsule and fibrous membranes of both loose titanium and cobalt-chromium stems.\n Prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, and collagenase levels are elevated when compared to control values with collagenase having the highest and most consistent elevations.\n Synovial fluid and blood ion readings were elevated in loose cemented and cementless stems made from both materials.\n Blood ion readings were not elevated in fixed stems.\n Fixed stems had much less particulate debris in soft tissues.\n The data showed that failure of most metal hip stems was initially due to a mechanical cause, with high debris and ion counts occurring secondarily in capsule and fibrous membranes.\n Particulate debris and high ion readings are primarily a focal problem contained by the periprosthetic fibrous connective-tissue encapsulation within the femoral canal and joint capsules.\n No systemic problems were manifest in any of the patients examined and followed in this study.",
