  "text": "Role of leukotriene B4 in granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic feline intestine.\n Several studies have demonstrated that granulocytes accumulate in the intestinal mucosa following ischemia/reperfusion.\n It has been suggested that leukotriene B4 may be released during ischemia/reperfusion and consequently may promote granulocyte infiltration into the mucosa.\n The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa.\n Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion.\n Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour.\n Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay.\n Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples.\n In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels.\n The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St.\n Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors.\n Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes.\n These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel.",
