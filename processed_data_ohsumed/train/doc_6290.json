  "text": "Total bladder replacement using detubularized sigmoid colon: technique and results.\n We performed total bladder replacement with a detubularized segment of sigmoid colon in patients after cystoprostatectomy.\n The surgical technique and long-term results in 27 patients are reported.\n This neobladder configuration compared favorably with other neobladder types regarding ease of construction.\n The surgical complications were acceptable.\n Initial reservoir function was good but improved further with time.\n After 1 year the capacity averaged 600 cc, pressures during filling and at capacity were low (average 12 and 16 cm.\n water) and emptying was satisfactory (residual urine 4 to 80 cc).\n All patients were continent during the day and 67% were continent at night without excessive voiding habits.\n Nighttime incontinence was further resolved in 2 patients by using the AMS 800 artificial sphincter around the bulbous urethra.\n The detubularized sigmoid is an excellent neobladder configuration after cystoprostatectomy.",
