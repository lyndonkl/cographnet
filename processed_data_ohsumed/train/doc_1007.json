  "text": "A pitfall in azygos vein cannulation in cirrhotic patients: mistaken cannulation of the mammary vein.\n Azygos venous flow can be measured by a thermodilution catheter in patients with cirrhosis.\n This is a useful technique since azygos flow is thought to reflect the superior portosystemic collateral flow in these patients.\n The authors report 3 cases in which mistaken internal mammary vein cannulation mimicked azygos vein cannulation in the supine fluoroscopic view.\n A lateral fluoroscopic view confirmed internal mammary cannulation.\n They suggest that if the azygos arch is unpronounced or flow measurements are unexpectedly low in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, a lateral view be performed to rule out internal mammary vein cannulation.",
