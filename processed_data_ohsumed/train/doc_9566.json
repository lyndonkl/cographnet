  "text": "Silk-induced asthma in children: a report of 64 cases.\n A total of 64 children less than 15 years of age with asthma caused by silk were studied.\n The diagnosis was based on a history of wheezing, positive skin tests to silk, positive conjunctival or nasal provocation tests, or serum IgE-Sw (silk waste).\n The average age of onset was 4 years 2 months.\n Sex ratio (M:F) was 3.6:1.\n A positive skin test is essential for the diagnosis.\n Conjunctival provocation tests were performed in 80% of cases because of reliability, safety, and convenience.\n The first symptom appeared an average of 10 months after initial exposure to silk.\n In 61% of patients, asthma was accompanied by allergic rhinitis but in only 14% of cases by conjunctivitis.\n In most cases, asthma occurred in winter, due to seasonal use of bed quilts or clothes filled with silk.\n Silk is a highly potent allergen.\n The average mean wheal diameter elicited by silk in prick testing was larger than two histamine equivalent prick tests.\n A cross reactivity exists among mulberry silk, and silkworm cocoons, batryticated silkworms, and silkworm chrysalis.",
