  "text": "Prevalence of Raynaud phenomenon in the adult population of South Carolina.\n A prevalence estimate for Raynaud phenomenon among adult residents of South Carolina was based on data obtained from respondents in a statewide health survey, followed by face-to-face interviews and clinical screening for Raynaud phenomenon, using a screening procedure developed by the authors.\n The survey obtained 5246 personal interviews from a probability sample of over 3000 households, and 494 survey subjects participated in the clinical screening.\n The prevalence estimates and their standard errors were computed using survey case weights, design-based estimation, and logistic modelling techniques.\n The prevalence of Raynaud phenomenon among adult residents of South Carolina was determined to be 3.5%, with a standard error of 0.6%.\n Prevalence was higher for females (4.3%, SE = 0.7%) than for males (2.7%, SE = 0.6%).\n These figures are much lower than most estimates in the existing literature on Raynaud phenomenon.",
