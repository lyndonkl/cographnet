  "text": "Molecular defect of the band 3 protein in southeast Asian ovalocytosis \n BACKGROUND.\n Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is a form of hereditary elliptocytosis in which the red cells are rigid and resistant to malaria invasion.\n The underlying molecular defect is unknown.\n METHODS AND RESULTS.\n We studied the red cells of 54 patients with ovalocytosis and 122 normal controls.\n We found that ovalocytes contain a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein, the principal transmembrane protein of red cells.\n The structural lesion of ovalocyte band 3 was revealed by limited proteolytic cleavage of the protein, which produced fragments of abnormal size that were derived from the cytoplasmic domain of the protein.\n The structural lesion was present in all the subjects with ovalocytosis but none of the controls.\n This region of band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1.\n The structural defect is dominantly inherited, being tightly linked with the inheritance of ovalocytosis (the probability of linkage is in excess of 10 million to 1).\n Ovalocyte band 3 bound considerably more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 protein.\n This tight binding of ovalocyte band 3 to the underlying skeleton containing ankyrin was directly confirmed in intact cells by the finding that ovalocyte band 3 had markedly reduced lateral mobility in the membrane.\n CONCLUSIONS.\n The red cells in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis carry a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein.\n This molecular defect may underlie the increased rigidity of the red cells and their resistance to invasion by malaria parasites.",
