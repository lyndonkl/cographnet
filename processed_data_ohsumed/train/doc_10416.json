  "text": "The use of conchal cartilage graft in involutional entropion.\n A simple and stable technique for repairing involutional entropion is described.\n Through a transconjunctival incision between the lower border of tarsus and the lower lid retractor, the eyelid is divided between the tarsus and the orbicularis oculi muscle into external and internal layers.\n The internal layer is moved upward until the eyelashes turn outward, and then through-and-through sutures are placed to fix it in this corrected state.\n The resultant defect between the lower end of the tarsus and the retractor is filled with a conchal cartilage graft.\n The raw surface of the cartilage is epithelialized from the surrounding mucosa within 1 to 2 weeks without shrinkage.\n This technique is more stable than any other technique that we have performed.",
