  "text": "Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) in women with bicornuate uteri.\n Fourteen women with bicornuate uteri underwent a total of 30 gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.\n All patients responded adequately to ovarian stimulation.\n Eight women conceived, two of them twice.\n Five women delivered at term and three had a premature delivery.\n There was one spontaneous abortion and an ectopic pregnancy.\n No neonatal deaths occurred in this series.\n No increase in the incidence of spontaneous abortion was noted but there appeared to be an increase in the incidence of premature labor.\n These findings suggest that the prospects of conception for infertile women with bicornuate uteri treated with gamete intrafallopian transfer are similar to those of the rest of the infertile population treated at our center.",
