  "text": "Minitracheotomy: complications and follow-up with fibreoptic tracheoscopy.\n Complications and changes in tracheal mucosa after minitracheotomy were evaluated in 28 patients.\n Tracheal mucosa was inspected fibreoptically after the insertion of a minitracheotomy cannula, and then at 3-day intervals until the cannula was removed.\n Thereafter, assessments were made every third day until the mucosa was considered normal.\n Three significant complications occurred: mediastinal puncture, paratracheal entrance of the cannula and subcutaneous emphysema.\n Difficulties at insertion of the minitracheotomy cannula were encountered in 15 of 28 patients (54%).\n Air flow detected through the cannula in one patient, and lack of air flow in another patient, were misleading signs of the position of the cannula.\n Passing a suction catheter in three patients and a normal end-tidal carbon dioxide tracing in one patient, were also found to be misleading.\n The correct position and possible complications could be verified only by fibreoptic tracheoscopy.\n Changes in the tracheal mucosa were independent of the duration of minitracheotomy therapy.",
