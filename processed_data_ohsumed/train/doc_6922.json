A case with peculiar endoscopic ultrasonographic pattern.\n We report a case of primary esophageal non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma in a young white female.\n At admission, endoscopy revealed large, irregularly shaped, esophageal ulcerations with super imposed candidiasis.\n Endoscopic ultrasonography to assess submucosal alterations and periesophageal involvement revealed a diffuse hypoechogenic thickening (up to 5 mm) of the esophageal wall, a pattern consistent with lymphomatous infiltration.\n Definitive diagnosis was made with the aid of histology and immunohistochemistry.",
