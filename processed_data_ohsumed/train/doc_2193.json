  "text": "Bradyarrhythmia after heart transplantation. Incidence, time course, and outcome.\n From June 1980 to April 1989, 72 of 401 (18%) adult recipients of orthotopic heart transplantation developed prolonged (greater than 24 hours) bradyarrhythmias (less than 60 beats/min) within 5 days after transplantation.\n Junctional bradycardia occurred in 50 (69%) recipients, sinus bradycardia in 18 (25%), and slow ventricular response during atrial fibrillation in four (6%).\n Fifty-five of 72 (76%) patients had bradyarrhythmias of less than 20 days' duration (less than 7 days, 50 patients; 7-20 days, five patients).\n Fifty patients returned to sinus rhythm (greater than 60 beats/min) by the time of discharge.\n Five patients expired within 20 days.\n Seventeen of 72 (24%) patients had bradyarrhythmia for more than 20 days, which was symptomatic in 11.\n All 17 patients (junctional bradycardia, 13 patients; sinus bradycardia, four patients) received a permanent pacemaker within 40 days after transplantation.\n Between 1 and 12 months (mean, 4 +/- 3 months) after pacemaker implantation, 12 patients recovered sinus rhythm (greater than 70 beats/min).\n The other five patients had intrinsic rates of 32-57 beats/min (mean, 48 +/- 10 beats/min) during 1-9 months (mean, 4 +/- 3 months) of follow-up.\n The donor ischemic time in bradyarrhythmia patients was 202 +/- 34 minutes, which was significantly longer (p less than 0.01) than the 173 +/- 43 minutes for those patients without bradyarrhythmia.\n Conclusively, the incidence of posttransplantation bradyarrhythmia is relatively high.\n It is usually temporary, however, even in patients with a prolonged duration of bradyarrhythmia.\n A relation appears to exist between donor ischemic time and the incidence of bradyarrhythmia.",
