  "text": "Dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery with pulmonary hypertension.\n Pulmonary artery dissection was observed in a 64-yr-old female patient with severe pulmonary hypertension, which was probably primary (pulmonary vascular resistance, 817 dyn.s.cm-5; normal range less than or equal to 200 dyn.s.cm-5).\n The patient was admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea on exertion.\n Echocardiography demonstrated a dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery.\n Right heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 64 mm Hg; normal range, 10 to 22 mm Hg); dissection of the pulmonary artery was confirmed by pulmonary arteriography.\n One-year follow-up was uneventful.\n In the literature, 28 patients with dissecting aneurysm of the pulmonary artery are reviewed.\n The dissection has only been diagnosed in life in one patient (by echocardiography).",
