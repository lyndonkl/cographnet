  "text": "Herpes simplex virus hepatitis in pregnancy. Two patients successfully treated with acyclovir.\n Two cases of herpes simplex virus hepatitis in pregnancy are presented.\n Each case was characterized by extremely high serum aminotransferase levels with minimal bilirubin elevation.\n In both cases, liver biopsy was instrumental in arriving at the diagnosis.\n In addition, computed tomography showed a radiographic appearance of the liver not characteristically seen in other hepatic disorders of pregnancy.\n A high index of suspicion in the second case led to early recognition and treatment.\n Despite the presence of fulminant liver failure and evidence of herpes encephalitis in the other case, institution of therapy with acyclovir was associated with complete recovery in both patients.\n The present cases are compared and contrasted with the literature.\n The incidence of two cases within a 6-month period suggests that herpes simplex virus hepatitis in pregnancy may occur more frequently than previously reported.",
