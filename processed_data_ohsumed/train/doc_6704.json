  "text": "Rapid diagnosis of lung cancer from palpable metastases by needle thrust.\n This study encourages the use of percutaneous FNB to diagnose and stage advanced lung cancer in patients with palpable metastases in supraclavicular lymph nodes or soft tissues.\n Percutaneous FNB of metastases is much easier to learn than transthoracic needle aspiration: the superficial target is anchored and sampled with multiple passes using a short needle grasped directly in the fingers.\n It is fast, accurate, economical and nearly free of risk and pain.\n The technique saves time and money because it is the only procedure needed by many patients with palpable disease in stage IIIB and IV.\n Bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration and open surgical biopsy thus can be avoided in most patients with palpable metastases.\n Prompt diagnosis by FNB of metastases speeds palliation for patients with urgent need.\n Tumor cell type from FNB correlated with cytologic findings from sputum samples, bronchoscopy specimens and autopsy results.",
