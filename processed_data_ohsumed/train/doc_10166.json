  "text": "Placental histology in fetuses between 18 and 23 weeks' gestation with abnormal karyotype.\n Placentas from karyotypically abnormal fetuses (18 to 23 weeks' gestation) were analyzed prospectively at the light microscopic level.\n Group I consisted of 14 control placentas.\n Group II consisted of 14 placentas from fetuses with an abnormal karyotype.\n Secondary and tertiary stem villi counts, small muscular artery counts, and total vessel counts were determined per 100 x field.\n There were no differences in secondary and tertiary stem villi counts between groups.\n A significant decrease in small muscular artery counts (p less than 0.01) and total vessel counts (p less than 0.01) was noted in group II.\n Placental and fetal weights were comparable between groups.\n This undervascularization may represent placental immaturity as a result of arrested or delayed angiopoiesis.\n It appears that this abnormality is established before the third trimester and may be enhanced by late vascular obliteration as reported by others.\n These data substantiate the concept that the structure and function of the placenta is determined to a great degree by fetal karyotype and may help explain the morbidity and mortality seen in these fetuses.",
