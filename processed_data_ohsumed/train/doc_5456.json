  "text": "Endolymphatic hydrops precipitated by haemodialysis.\n We report a case of endolymphatic hydrops preceded by haemodialysis in the contralateral ear of a patient with known Meniere's disease, and discuss the possible mechanism.\n It is suggested that the sudden decrease of plasma osmolality during haemodialysis acts as a reverse glycerol test.\n The audiometric and electrophysiological recordings pre- and post-dialysis and the induction of the Meniere's triad of symptoms during dialysis, were strongly indicative of the presence of endolymphatic hydrops.",
