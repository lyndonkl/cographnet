  "text": "Total knee arthroplasty in diabetes mellitus.\n A retrospective study was done of 59 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) in 40 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.\n The overall infection rate was 7%, with an overall revision rate of 10% and an average follow-up period of 4.3 years.\n Wound complications were present in 12% of the TKAs.\n The rate of deep joint infections in diabetic patients was statistically higher than the reported incidence of sepsis in nondiabetic patients.\n Therefore, maximum precautions should be taken for diabetic patients having TKA to minimize both wound complications and joint sepsis.",
