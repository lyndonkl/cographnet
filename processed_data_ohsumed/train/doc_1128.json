  "text": "Superficial cultures in neonatal sepsis evaluations. Impact on antibiotic decision making.\n The authors performed a retrospective analysis of neonatal superficial cultures and their effect on antimicrobial decision making during a nine-month period at Nashville General Hospital.\n They obtained and reviewed charts of infants (n = 66) having paired superficial (skin and/or gastric aspirate) and deep (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) cultures for the evaluation of early-onset sepsis.\n Superficial cultures were positive for pathogens (any streptococcus or enteric gram-negative) in 15% (10/66) of cases.\n Antimicrobial decision making was affected in only one of these cases, and in a seemingly inappropriate manner.\n In summary, there was no evidence or review that superficial cultures used in sepsis evaluation influenced physician antimicrobial decision making; in one case they may have led to unnecessary antibiotic exposure.",
