  "text": "Tumor necrosis factor-increased hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein production and increased serum triglyceride levels in diabetic rats.\n Previous studies demonstrated that administration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to diabetic rats rapidly increases serum triglyceride levels and stimulates hepatic lipogenesis without affecting the activity of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase or serum insulin levels.\n The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which TNF increases serum triglyceride levels and stimulates hepatic fatty acid synthesis in diabetic animals.\n The maximal increase (approximately 2-fold) in serum triglyceride levels in diabetic rats is seen with a dose of 10 micrograms TNF/200 g body wt, and the half-maximal effect is observed with 5 micrograms TNF/200 g body wt.\n The clearance of labeled triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation is not affected by TNF administration (triglyceride t 1/2; diabetic vs.\n TNF-administered diabetic, 3.5 +/- 0.7 vs.\n 4.0 +/- 0.6 min, respectively; NS).\n The production of triglyceride, measured by the Triton WR-1339 technique, is increased twofold in diabetic animals after TNF administration.\n These results indicate that the rapid increase in serum triglyceride levels after TNF treatment is accounted for by increased hepatic lipoprotein secretion.\n TNF administration did not alter either the amount or activation state of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key regulatory enzyme in fatty acid synthesis.\n There was also no change in the hepatic levels of fatty acyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.\n However, there was a 71% increase in hepatic citrate concentrations.\n Citrate is an allosteric activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and changes in hepatic citrate concentrations have been shown to mediate changes in the rates of fatty acid synthesis.",
