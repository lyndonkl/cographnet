  "text": "Pineal hyperactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats: muscarinic regulation of indole metabolism.\n 1.\n Choline acetyltransferase activity and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate-binding sites were detected in the pineal gland of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and of spontaneously hypertensive rats.\n 2.\n In vitro, muscarinic activation by pilocarpine increased the pineal metabolic production of hydroxyindole derivatives up to 5-hydroxytryptamine and produced a less marked stimulation of melatonin biosynthesis.\n 3.\n Electrical field stimulation of pineal gland slices caused similar metabolic effects.\n 4.\n Muscarinic blockade with atropine inhibited the effects on hydroxyindole metabolism.\n 5.\n [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzylate-binding sites, indicative of muscarinic receptors, were more numerous, and basal 5-hydroxytryptamine and melatonin levels were higher, in the pineal gland of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats.\n 6.\n The atropine-sensitive metabolic effects of pilocarpine and electrical field stimulation on the pineal gland were increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats.",
