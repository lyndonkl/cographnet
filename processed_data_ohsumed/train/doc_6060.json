  "text": "Treatment of craniomaxillofacial fibrous dysplasia: how early and how extensive?\n Twenty-eight craniomaxillofacial fibrous dysplasia patients were treated as early as the symptoms occurred.\n The principles of surgical treatment were based on the zones of involvement: total excision of dysplastic bone of fronto-orbital, zygoma, and upper maxillary origin (zone 1) and bone reconstruction primarily; conservative excision on hair-bearing skull (zone 2), central cranial base (zone 3), and tooth-bearing bones (zone 4); and optic canal decompression on patients with orbital dysplasia and decreasing visual acuity.\n Patients were followed for 1 to 11 years (average 5.3 years).\n No recurrence or invasion of the fibrous dysplasia into the grafted bone was seen.\n One patient had orthognathic maxillary osteotomy on the reconstructed maxilla 6 years after initial reconstruction.\n Five of 19 patients with alveolar dysplasia had a recurrence and were reshaped.\n One patient had mandibular sagittal osteotomies to set back the prognathic, fibrous dysplasic mandible after three attempts at conservative shaving.\n Another patient with mandibular fibrous dysplasia had recurrence with pain and a hemimandibulectomy with successful immediate free vascularized iliac bone graft reconstruction.",
