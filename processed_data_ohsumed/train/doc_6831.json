  "text": "Clinical evaluation of a side entry access port: a novel dual-lumen venous access device.\n The initial clinical experience with a low-profile side entry access (SEA) dual-lumen implantable venous access port for cancer chemotherapy administration is summarized in this report.\n The catheter material is polyurethane.\n The overall experience in 35 patients in this study was a total of 6,224 patient days, with a mean of 178 days per patient.\n A variety of chemotherapeutic agents, biologic response modifiers, and antibiotics were administered.\n In 26% of the patients, the device chambers were in simultaneous use during the treatment period.\n A 6% incidence of clinical subclavian vein thrombosis was noted.\n There was no infectious complications.\n Inconsistencies in blood withdrawal and temporary catheter dysfunction were comparable to other access ports in clinical use.\n The novel design of this side entry port and the catheter material of low thrombogenicity make this device a good option in patients requiring a low-profile system and dual access.\n Nursing staff should be made aware of the side entry design and that in-service training for accessing the septum is required in centers where such devices are not routinely used.",
