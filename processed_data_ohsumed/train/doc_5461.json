  "text": "Various methods for calculation of Kt/V: a clinical comparison.\n Analysis of the National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) showed that dialysis morbidity and mortality was related to Kt/V of urea.\n Various formulas have been derived to make calculation of Kt/V simpler.\n We compared the kinetically measured Kt/V (A) to estimated Kt/V derived from approximate total body water (0.6 body weight) and uniform dialyzer clearance (B), Kt/V = 0.04 PRU-1.2 where PRU is % reduction in BUN (C) and Kt/V = In(R-0.03-UF/W) where R is post/pre BUN, UF is ultrafiltration L/HD and W is postdialysis weight (D) in 26 patients.\n The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.14 (p less than 0.05) for A vs.\n B; 0.75 (p less than 0.01) A vs.\n C; 0.77 (p less than 0.01) A vs.\n D; and 0.97 for C vs.\n D.\n In an additional 51 patients, Kt/V was calculated using formulas B, C, and D.\n The r was 0.91 C vs.\n D, 0.70 B vs.\n D, and 0.68 B vs.\n C.\n With B, greater than 30% of the patients could have been misclassified using NCDS criteria for adequacy of dialysis.\n The study suggests that use of formulas C and D, but not B, is appropriate and accurate for Kt/V calculation.\n Formula C may be simpler and easier than D, as UF and W are not required.\n Serial Kt/V could be easily and accurately calculated using C and D for quality assurance and quantitation of dialysis.",
