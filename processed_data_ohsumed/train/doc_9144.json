  "text": "Multiple parathyroid adenomas: report of thirty-three cases.\n An increasing number of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are found to have two or three enlarged parathyroid glands.\n Of 865 patients successfully operated on by one surgeon (J.N.A.), multiple enlarged parathyroid glands (adenomas) were found and resected in 33 cases (3.8%), with resulting normocalcemia lasting from 1 to 22 years (mean 5.8).\n Twenty-nine patients had two adenomas and four had three adenomas.\n In 28 patients the multiple adenomas were synchronous.\n Twenty-five patients underwent removal of all of the enlarged parathyroid glands in one operation; in three patients one adenoma was removed, reoperation for persistent hypercalcemia was performed, and a second adenoma was resected with cure.\n In five patients one adenoma was removed, normocalcemia ensued for 3 to 18 years, and a second (metachronous) adenoma occurred and was resected successfully.\n Although 10 of 70 enlarged parathyroid glands removed were labeled hyperplasia, cure in all but one of our patients by selective resection of only enlarged parathyroid glands emphasizes the unreliability of histologic criteria in differentiating between parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia.\n Based on this study, we support the existence of multiple adenomas and advocate removal of only macroscopically enlarged parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.",
