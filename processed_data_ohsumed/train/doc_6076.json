  "text": "Effects of rib elongation on the spine. I. Distortion of the vertebral alignment in the rabbit.\n Elongation of one rib on the right side by 1 cm was achieved in two groups of adult rabbits of different age, by osteotomy and application of a metallic expander.\n The procedure resulted in immediate deviation of the spine in the frontal and sagittal planes, with moderate scoliosis, convex to the left, and a significant decrease in the normal cervicothoracic lordosis and thoracolumbar kyphosis.\n Moreover, computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated rotation of vertebra about the longitudinal axis relative to the anterior midline of the body, and deviation of the spinous process toward the convex, left side, of the scoliotic deformity.\n Rib hump developed on the right side--that of the elongated rib.\n These changes, which occurred simultaneously in the three planes, were less pronounced in the group of older animals.\n Two weeks after the operation, the distorted configuration of the spine remained unchanged.\n The observed changes in the alignment of the vertebrae--changes that, except for their direction on the horizontal plane, resembled those associated with idiopathic scoliosis in man--support the earlier proposed link between the early stage of development of this condition and asymmetry of rib growth.",
