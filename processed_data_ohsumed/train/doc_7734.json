  "text": "Alcohol-dependent unilateral vestibular impairment persisting after a closed head injury.\n A 20-year-old man suffered a closed head injury followed by symptoms of right-sided labyrinthine concussion with complete clinical recovery within 3 weeks.\n Episodic vertigo and ataxic gait occurred after the ingestion of small amounts of alcohol over the next 2 years.\n Electro-oculography revealed a right-sided peripheral type vestibular lesion, only after taking alcohol.\n This was interpreted as an alcohol-induced impairment of central compensation following an incomplete recovery from right-sided labyrinthine trauma.",
