  "text": "Traumatic disruptions of the thoracic aorta: treatment and outcome.\n Of 27 patients admitted to our level I trauma center with acute disruption of the thoracic aorta, two patients died of exsanguination before aortic repair.\n One patient had massive leakage from the aneurysm after aortography and died during surgery.\n All patients suffered from multiple injuries.\n Eighty-three percent of the patients had major operations in addition to the aortic repair.\n \"Clamp and sew\" technique was used in 18 patients (75%), two of whom had multiple tears of the aortic arch.\n Heparin-coated shunts were used in five patients (20.8%), and a cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in one patient who had multiple tears.\n Three postoperative deaths were related to polytrauma, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis.\n Paraplegia developed in three patients, two of whom had multiple aortic lesions necessitating longer ischemia time during the repair.\n Only one patient had complete neurologic deficit at the 1-year follow-up.\n In our series, neither surgical procedure proved superior.\n We conclude that the \"clamp and sew\" technique for repair of the disrupted thoracic aorta may allow for a more favorable outcome.",
