  "text": "Iliac artery stenosis and occlusion: preliminary results of treatment with Gianturco expandable metallic stents.\n Ten patients with atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the iliac artery were treated with Gianturco expandable metallic stents.\n In the five cases of stenosis, only balloon dilation was performed prior to placement of stents.\n The five patients with occluded arteries were given intraarterial infusions of urokinase before balloon dilation and stent placement.\n Clinical symptoms improved in all patients, and no technical failures or complications occurred.\n Doppler ankle-brachial index studies were performed in nine cases, and in all nine cases the indexes improved after stent placement.\n During follow-up of 2-18 months (mean, 10.3 months), all arteries remained patent.\n Follow-up angiograms showed slight intimal thickening and no restenosis.\n Long-term follow-up and more clinical experience will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this stent.\n However, preliminary results suggest that the Gianturco expandable metallic stent is of value in the treatment of arterial occlusive disease.",
