  "text": "Anisocoria in the pigmentary dispersion syndrome \n We studied four patients with anisocoria and the pigmentary dispersion syndrome.\n In all patients, the larger pupil was on the side of the greater iris transillumination.\n The amount of anisocoria was between 0.5 and 1.5 mm and was the same in both the light and dark.\n There was no blepharoptosis, and all pupils dilated normally with cocaine.\n All of the patients were young men with myopia, and one patient had increased intraocular pressure.",
