  "text": "Epithelial rests' function in replantation: is splinting necessary in replantation?\n The problem of resorption during replantation in relationship to the epithelial rests and a lack of splinting was studied.\n Ten mongrel dogs were used.\n Two dogs served as control subjects, while eight had their mandibular incisors intentionally replanted and studied histologically.\n It was observed that where rests of Malassez were present we did not see resorption, and the lack of splinting did not result in resorption or loss of teeth.\n It appears we can stain epithelial rests of Malassez with immunofluorescent antibodies and use this technique for further study of this tissue.",
