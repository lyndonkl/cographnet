  "text": "Intrauterine spermatic cord torsion in the newborn: sonographic and pathologic correlation.\n In five newborn patients with spermatic cord torsion, sonography demonstrated an enlarged and globular testis, hydrocele, and skin thickening.\n In four of these patients the testicular parenchyma was heterogeneous.\n Peripheral hypoechoic areas were seen in two of the four patients; the other two had a central hypoechoic region and a peripheral echogenic rim.\n The testis in the fifth patient was diffusely hyperechoic.\n Duplex Doppler sonography performed in two patients failed to demonstrate any signal in the spermatic cord in either the abnormal or contralateral hemiscrotum.\n Scintigraphic findings were positive for testicular torsion in two patients and equivocal in three patients.\n Surgery was performed 2-12 days after sonography and established the diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion.\n Pathologic examination demonstrated hemorrhagic infarction of the entire testis as well as scattered calcifications.\n The authors conclude that a solid globular testicular mass seen during the neonatal period is suggestive of intrauterine spermatic cord torsion.",
