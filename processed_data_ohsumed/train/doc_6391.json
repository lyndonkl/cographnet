  "text": "Cerebral tumor staging in patients with bronchial carcinoma by computed tomography.\n Computerized tomographic (CT) scans of 271 patients with histologically proven bronchial carcinoma accomplished for initial tumor staging were retrospectively evaluated for signs of cerebral metastasis.\n The results for the histologic subtypes were quite different.\n In 13.8% of patients with small cell carcinoma and limited disease the authors found signs of brain metastasis.\n However, routine cerebral staging in these patients did not seem to be useful because of lack of therapeutic consequences.\n On the other hand, no patient with non-small cell carcinoma (N-SCC) and tumor Stage I or II had brain metastases.\n All patients with brain metastasis from N-SCC had been classified as tumor Stage III before cerebral imaging.\n Among these patients, however, the authors found brain metastasis in 17.5% of those without known distant metastatic disease (III/M0), especially in large cell carcinoma and in adenocarcinoma.\n Stage III/M0 patients should undergo routine cerebral imaging if their tumor is surgically resectable and thoracotomy is planned.",
