  "text": "Neutrophilic dermatosis with myelodysplastic syndrome: nuclear segmentation anomalies of neutrophils in the skin lesion and in peripheral blood.\n Neutrophilic dermatosis developed in two patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.\n Biopsy specimens of their skin lesions showed marked infiltration by neutrophils with nuclear anomalies, that is, hyposegmentation (pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly) or hypersegmentation.\n Peripheral blood and bone marrow neutrophils had similar anomalies.\n To our knowledge, this is the first report of nuclear segmentation anomalies of neutrophils in neutrophilic dermatosis skin lesions of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.",
