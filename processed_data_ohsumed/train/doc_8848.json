  "text": "The radial forearm flap for reconstruction of the upper extremity.\n The radial forearm flap, owing to its good-caliber arteries of long length and equally well distributed venous system, has proved very reliable.\n It has not only earned its place and recognition in reconstructive hand surgery, but also has emerged as a workhorse for the microvascular surgeon.\n We have used 14 radial forearm flaps for upper extremity reconstruction, and we present herein our experience.\n The technique of extracorporeal tissue transfer, which has been published elsewhere, was used in two patients and is detailed.\n Four representative patients are presented.",
