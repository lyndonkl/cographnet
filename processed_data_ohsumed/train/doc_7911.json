  "text": "Gallbladder surgery following cholecystlithotripsy: suggested guidelines for treatment \n Twenty-three of 229 symptomatic patients undergoing cholecystlithotripsy underwent surgical intervention: 22 of the patients had cholecystectomy performed (five also undergoing choledochotomy) and one patient had a cholecystostomy.\n Of these 23 patients, five were lithotripsy failures, five developed acute pancreatitis, one had acute cholecystitis, and one had cholangitis.\n One patient had her gallbladder removed incidentally at the time of surgery for a bleeding gastric ulcer.\n Ten patients underwent surgery for recurrent biliary pain, probably related to fragment passage via the cystic duct.\n We suggest that up to 16 of these 23 patients did not necessarily require cholecystectomy, i.e.\n five patients with pancreatitis, one patient with cholangitis and ten patients with recurrent biliary colic.\n Conservative and/or endoscopic management may be successful in the first instance to allow further treatment with lithotripsy in the majority of patients.\n If, however, the expertise to perform endoscopic sphincterotomy is not available or the patient declines further lithotripsy, then resort to surgery may be necessary.\n We propose that it is the responsibility of the management team in charge of the lithotripsy unit to inform both the patient and the referring clinicians of the possible side-effects and outcome of treatment in an attempt to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures.",
