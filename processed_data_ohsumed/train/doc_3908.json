  "text": "Percutaneous balloon dilatation of benign biliary strictures.\n Percutaneous biliary dilatation is an effective alternative to surgical management of benign biliary strictures that has low morbidity and no reported mortality.\n Reported success rates for this procedure range from 40% to 90% depending on the size of the series, the type of patient being treated, and the length of follow-up period.\n The procedure is done in the fluoroscopy suite with an angioplasty balloon catheter.\n Transhepatic access is most common, but the procedure may be done via existing T-tube tracts or specially created jejunal loops.\n As the frequency of radical liver surgery such as liver transplant and radical trisegmentectomy rises, so too, the rate of biliary stricture is likely to rise, making percutaneous balloon dilatation an increasingly important tool in the interventional radiologist's armamentarium.",
