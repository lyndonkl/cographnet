  "text": "IgA nephritis in Behcet's disease: case report and review of the literature.\n We describe a 13-year-old girl with the incomplete type of Behcet's disease who had recurrent oral and genital ulcers, folliculitis, proteinuria and hematuria.\n Renal biopsy specimens revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with strongly positive IgA deposits in the glomerular mesangial area, which is histologically indistinguishable from primary IgA nephritis.\n Further studies of the IgA subclasses showed that IgA1 deposits were predominant in the glomerular mesangium.\n Primary IgA nephritis is thought to be associated with polymeric IgA1.\n So it appears that there may be a common underlying disease or mechanism involved in both primary IgA nephritis and the IgA nephritis in Behcet's disease.",
