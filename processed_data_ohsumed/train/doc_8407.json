  "text": "The prognosis of contact dermatitis.\n This article reviews the prognosis of contact dermatitis, particularly of occupational contact dermatitis.\n Most studies document a poor prognosis for occupational and nonoccupational contact dermatitis.\n The prognoses of occupational and nonoccupational contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis are similar.\n Only a minority of studies on the prognosis of occupational contact dermatitis have found that a job change by the affected worker leads to clearing of the dermatitis.\n Dermatologic and nondermatologic factors associated with a poor prognosis are discussed.",
