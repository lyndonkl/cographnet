  "text": "Pathogenesis and treatment of intra-abdominal infection.\n Intra-abdominal infection is considered potentially life-threatening.\n Such infection is frequently secondary to perforated viscera, trauma or inflammatory disease.\n Simple abscesses may be drained percutaneously with roentgenologic guidance; complex abscesses often require open surgical drainage.\n Secondary peritonitis is usually polymicrobial; broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy effective against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, as well as gram-positive organisms, is essential.\n Newer antibiotics, administered either singly or in combination, have been used successfully to treat intra-abdominal infection while avoiding the toxicity of aminoglycosides.",
