  "text": "Rearrangement of immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor, and bcl-2 genes in malignant lymphomas in Hong Kong.\n The pattern of malignant lymphomas in the Hong Kong Chinese population is characterized by a low incidence of Hodgkin's disease and follicular lymphomas.\n The authors studied the immunoglobulin (Ig), T-cell receptor (TCR), and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 62 cases of malignant lymphoma in this population by Southern blot hybridization.\n Two cases of Hodgkin's disease showed no rearrangement of the Ig and TCR genes.\n All 42 cases of B-cell lymphoma had Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement with or without additional rearrangement of the light chains (C kappa and C lambda).\n One case of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had additional T-cell receptor beta-chain (C beta) rearrangement.\n Sixteen of 18 cases of T-cell lymphoma had C beta rearrangement, and one case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma had additional JH rearrangement.\n Two of eight (25%) cases of follicular lymphoma but only one of the 34 (2.9%) cases of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had bcl-2 rearrangement that was detected by pFL-1 probe.\n None of the 62 cases showed bcl-2 rearrangement using the pFL-2 probe.\n In conclusion, the Ig and TCR gene rearrangement pattern of the lymphomas found in Hong Kong correlates well with the T-cell and B-cell lineage, which is similar to reports in the white population.\n However, the incidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in follicular B-cell lymphoma is lower than that reported in the US but comparable with that in Japan.",
