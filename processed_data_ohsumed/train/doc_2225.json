  "text": "Use of the variable-length intraluminal sutureless graft.\n From August 1987 to May 1988 we treated 4 patients with acute ascending aortic dissections with a variable-length intraluminal aortic prosthesis.\n This operation uses profound hypothermic circulatory arrest and represents a refinement of existing techniques.\n There was no mortality, and morbidity was minimal.\n Modifications of this technique can be used in performing proximal aortic root reconstruction with a composite valved conduit.\n The use of a variable-length intraluminal prosthesis and hypothermic circulatory arrest is illustrated.\n This is a safe and useful technique in select cases of acute ascending aortic dissection.",
