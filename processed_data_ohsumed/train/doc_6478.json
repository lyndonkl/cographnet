  "text": "Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and interleukin-1 by epithelial cells of Warthin's tumor.\n The immunoreactivity for class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in Warthin's tumor (WT) cells was studied.\n In addition to macrophages, dendritic cells, and capillary endothelia, the luminal tumor cells and some keratinocytes in the metaplastic squamous foci exhibited immunoreactivity for both class II antigens and IL-1.\n The distribution of the class II antigens in the luminal tumor cells was limited to their basolateral membrane.\n These data, together with previous findings, strongly suggest that the luminal tumor cells of WT introduce the luminal antigen to the underlying lymphoid tissue and, thus, act as an antigen-presenting cell.",
