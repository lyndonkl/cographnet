  "text": "Penetration of the pericardium by a gastric ulcer--survival after pericardiocentesis.\n Elderly patients often have unusual manifestations of common illnesses.\n We describe a geriatric patient having a pneumopericardium from pericardial penetration by a gastric ulcer.\n Benign gastric ulceration causing perforation of the pericardium or other cardiac structures was recognized as early as 1854; however, until 1964, the condition was invariably fatal.\n Our patient survived the episode after early pericardiocentesis and medical treatment.\n Aspects of this uncommon clinical entity and a brief review of the literature are described.",
