  "text": "Lobular pattern of choriocapillaris in pre-eclampsia with aldosteronism.\n We report a case of geographic or mosaic pattern yellowish opaque foci in the left eye of a 36-year-old woman who suffered from severe pre-eclampsia.\n Though the geographic lesions resulted in chorioretinal atrophy, the mosaic lesion led to no significant atrophy.\n These two findings were both diagnosed as manifestations of choroidal ischaemia, the former due to choroidal artery occlusion, the latter to transient insufficiency of choroidal circulation, which reflects the lobular pattern of the choriocapillaris.",
