  "text": "Cataract extraction in uveitis patients.\n Cataracts are known to develop at an accelerated rate in many forms of uveitis.\n Until recently, cataract surgery in such eyes was regarded as a hazardous procedure that yielded unpredictable and often discouraging results.\n Recent evidence from a number of reports suggests that newer surgical techniques and careful medical management allow a significant number of patients with uveitis to undergo cataract extraction successfully.\n Intraocular lens implantation using in-the-bag posterior chamber lens technique has been successful in selected cases.\n Careful patient selection, coupled with the use of an appropriate surgical technique, appear to be of major importance.\n Herein we review the current literature on cataract extraction in uveitis and provide guidelines for patient and technique selection based on the type of inflammation present.\n The management of common surgical problems and complications is discussed, as is the role of the intraocular lens.\n Specific surgical techniques useful in the management of eyes with cataract and uveitis are discussed.",
