  "text": "Use of single fiber EMG and macro EMG in study of reinnervation.\n The use of single fiber EMG and macro EMG in studies of reinnervation is discussed.\n SFEMG gives information about changes in the topography of the motor unit and in function of transmission in terminal nerve, motor endplate and muscle fiber.\n Dynamics of reinnervation may be studied with this technique.\n The amount of reinnervation is obtained from macro EMG studies.\n The capacity for reinnervation is discussed for a few conditions as well as factors that limit the reinnervation process.",
