  "text": "Clinical and Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of bioprosthetic valve failure after 10 years.\n Four hundred thirteen consecutive patients underwent valve replacement with a bioprosthesis between 1976 and 1982.\n Aortic valve replacement was performed in 240 patients, mitral valve replacement in 132 patients, and multiple valve replacement in 41.\n The Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 336), Angell-Shiley porcine (n = 23), Hancock porcine (n = 11), and the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (n = 43) were inserted.\n Follow-up between 5 and 12 years postoperatively was 98% complete.\n Freedom from structural valve deterioration was 72 +/- 7%, 59 +/- 9%, and 59 +/- 9%, respectively, after aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement.\n The risk of structural valve deterioration and reoperation for valve-related complications was significantly increased with the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial prosthesis.\n The risk for reoperation was inversely related to patient age.\n Postoperative Doppler echocardiographic studies in 87% of available patients revealed a subgroup of asymptomatic patients with evidence of structural valve deterioration.\n These patients (n = 61) had significantly reduced prosthetic valve areas (aortic less than 1 cm2, mitral less than 1.7 cm2), elevated resting transvalvular gradients (aortic greater than 40 mm Hg), or moderate-to-severe regurgitation.\n In summary, postoperative Doppler echocardiographic examination identified asymptomatic patients with structural valve dysfunction.\n These patients must be followed up carefully to determine the optimal timing of reoperation.",
