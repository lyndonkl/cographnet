  "text": "Feasibility of digital teleradiology for imaging evaluation of patients with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain.\n To assess the utility of a commercially available digital teleradiology system in evaluating patients with acute pain in the right upper quadrant, hard-copy images from 100 examinations (50 hepatobiliary scintigrams and 50 sonograms of the right upper quadrant) were digitized, transmitted via standard telephone lines, and viewed remotely on a video monitor.\n Video and hard-copy interpretations were then compared for degree of concordance.\n For the scintigraphic studies, hard-copy and video images were equal in demonstrating gallbladder and bile duct activity.\n Video images failed to depict the presence of bowel activity in one case.\n Gallstones were depicted equally well on hard-copy and video sonographic images.\n The video interpreters overestimated the presence of abnormal hepatic parenchyma and overlooked one case of right hydronephrosis.\n The video interpretations of the scintigrams and sonograms showed an overall error rate of 4%, comparable to the rate obtained when radiographs are interpreted remotely with digital teleradiology systems.",
