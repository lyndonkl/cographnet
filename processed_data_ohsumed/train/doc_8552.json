  "text": "Effect of endotoxin and a burn injury on lung and liver lipid peroxidation and catalase activity.\n Both endotoxin and a burn alone produce oxidant-induced tissue lipid peroxidation.\n The endotoxin response is due in large part to hydrogen peroxide.\n The combination of endotoxin after a burn results in an increased liver, but not lung, oxidant injury.\n Our purpose was to determine whether the burn oxidant injury inactivated endogenous liver tissue catalase, thereby amplifying a subsequent H2O2 insult.\n Twenty-six adult sheep were studied.\n Twelve sheep had a 15% TBS burn.\n Tissue catalase activity, measured in lung and liver 3 days postburn, was significantly decreased from a control of 3.58 +/- 1.8 and 193 +/- 63, respectively, to 1.72 +/- 0.63 and 148 +/- 33 k(sec-1)/0.5 gram tissue.\n The addition of endotoxin 3 days postburn resulted in an increase in liver malondialdehyde, MDA, a measure of lipid peroxidation, from a control of 110 +/- 80 to 450 +/- 54 nmol/gram tissue.\n This value was significantly greater than the 210 +/- 80 nmol/gram tissue seen after endotoxin alone.\n Lung tissue MDA with burn and endotoxin was 65 +/- 8 compared to 42 +/- 7 for control and 80 +/- 6 nmol/gram for endotoxin alone.\n We conclude that a decrease in liver catalase activity occurs after a burn.\n The decrease corresponds to an accentuated oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation after an added endotoxin insult where H2O2 is known to be an etiologic agent.\n The catalase activity also decreases in postburn lung, but accentuated lung damage was not seen, indicating a variable tissue response from the burn-induced decrease in antioxidant activity.",
