  "text": "Endourological experience with cystine calculi and a treatment algorithm.\n Between May 1984 and January 1988, 18 patients (31 pyeloureteral units) with documented symptomatic cystine stones were treated.\n Stone size ranged from 5 to 56 mm.\n in largest diameter, with an average of 21 mm.\n All pyeloureteral units were treated initially by endourological methods, including ureteroscopy in 10, percutaneous ultrasonic lithotripsy in 9, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 10 and chemolysis in 2.\n Of the patients 10 required a combination of these technologies and 2 required an open operation.\n Of the 31 units 23 were free of stones when the patient was discharged from the hospital.\n Of 8 patients with retained stones only 3 had fragments greater than 3 mm.\n in diameter.\n Based on this experience an algorithm was developed for the urological management of cystine stones.\n Ureteral calculi may be removed by ureteroscopic techniques or manipulated into the renal pelvis and managed as renal stones.\n Cystine renal calculi of less than 1.5 cm.\n may be treated with ESWL monotherapy.\n Stones of 1.5 to 3 cm.\n may be treated with ESWL and dissolution, or percutaneous ultrasonic lithotripsy plus dissolution.\n Staghorn calculi may be treated by percutaneous ultrasonic lithotripsy plus ESWL and/or dissolution for retained fragments.",
