  "text": "Clinical application of ras gene mutation for diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n Most pancreatic adenocarcinomas are known to have ras gene (oncogene) mutations.\n The site of the mutations is localized in codon 12 of K-ras gene.\n Such high incidence and localization of the ras gene mutations have not been observed in any other human malignancies.\n Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing method enabled us to analyze DNA sequence around codon 12 of K-ras gene in small quantities of specimens obtained from needle biopsies and aspirate samples for pathological diagnosis.\n All the materials obtained from 12 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed the mutations, whereas those obtained from 6 patients with chronic pancreatitis showed no mutations.\n In several cases using the mutations of K-ras gene as a marker, this analysis supplemented conventional pathology and cytology in making the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n The analysis of ras-gene mutations was useful for the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",
