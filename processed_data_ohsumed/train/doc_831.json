  "text": "Emphysematous gastritis: case report and review.\n Emphysematous gastritis is a condition involving gastric wall inflammation, radiologic or intraoperative evidence of intramural gas, and systemic toxicity.\n A recent case of emphysematous gastritis in a 57-year-old diabetic man is reported, and 27 cases published since 1889 are reviewed.\n Predisposing factors include ingestion of corrosive substances (37%) and alcohol abuse (22%).\n Diagnosis of emphysematous gastritis is based on the clinical presentation of an acute abdomen with systemic toxicity and on radiographs demonstrating gas bubbles within the stomach wall.\n For the case reported herein, computed tomography was useful both in establishing the diagnosis and in following the resolution of emphysematous gastritis.\n Organisms most commonly involved were Escherichia coli (six cases), Streptococcus species (six cases), Enterobacter species (five cases), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three cases).\n The mortality was 61% (17 of 28 patients), and morbidity with gastric contractures occurred in 21% of cases (6 of 28).\n Optimal therapy has not been defined; however, antimicrobial chemotherapy and surgery, when appropriate, may improve survival rates.",
