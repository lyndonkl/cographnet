  "text": "Residual atrial septal perforation after percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy with Inoue balloon catheter.\n To estimate the incidence of residual atrial septal perforation (ASP) following percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) with the Inoue balloon catheter and to examine the factors contributing to ASP, we studied 46 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing PTMC.\n Residual ASP was evaluated by Doppler color flow imaging 1 day after PTMC, and was detected in 7 out of 46 patients (15.2%).\n We examined the relationship between the development of ASP (ASP+) and the age of the patient, the left atrial dimension before PTMC, the mean pressure difference between left and right atrium after PTMC, and the duration of the procedure from atrial septal puncture by the Brockenbrough method to balloon inflation.\n There was a good correlation between the development of residual ASP and the duration of the procedure (ASP+, 51.0 +/- 34.0 minutes; without ASP, 24.6 +/- 16.2 minutes; p less than 0.01).\n However, there was no significant correlation between the development of ASP and other factors.\n In the follow-up study, ASP disappeared in four patients within 3 months.\n ASP persisted in two patients for 1 year after PTMC.\n However, the shunt in these two patients was clinically insignificant.\n These data suggest that residual ASP may depend on the duration of the procedure, and that most cases of ASP disappear within 1 year after PTMC.",
