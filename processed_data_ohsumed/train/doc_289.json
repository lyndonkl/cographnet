  "text": "Pentoxifylline attenuates edema formation in proteolytic enzyme-induced lung injury.\n Ex vivo canine lung lobes were exposed to a pancreatic proteolytic enzyme (chymotrypsin) alone or chymotrypsin after pretreatment with a continuous infusion with pentoxifylline.\n The lobes exposed to chymotrypsin gained 133 g, while the pentoxifylline-treated lobes gained only 65 g (p less than .05) over the 3-h experimental period.\n These results suggest that pentoxifylline significantly attenuates the lung weight gain associated with chymotrypsin.",
