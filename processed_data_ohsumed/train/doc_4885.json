  "text": "Brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula.\n A case of brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula was presented and 52 reported cases were reviewed.\n The brain abscess was successfully treated with repeated aspiration and drainage, and the pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, located in the right lower lobe, was resected.\n The arteriovenous fistula occurs as a common pulmonary manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; however, no symptoms suggesting these two were noted in this case.\n Brain abscesses can be an initial clinical manifestation in asymptomatic pulmonary arteriovenous fistula.\n This possible association should be borne in mind in cases of brain abscesses of unexplained etiology.",
