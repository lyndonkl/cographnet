  "text": "Relationship of oxygen dose to angiogenesis induction in irradiated tissue.\n This study was accomplished in an irradiated rabbit model to assess the angiogenic properties of normobaric oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen as compared with air-breathing controls.\n Results indicated that normobaric oxygen had no angiogenic properties above normal revascularization of irradiated tissue than did air-breathing controls (p = 0.89).\n Hyperbaric oxygen demonstrated an eight- to ninefold increased vascular density over both normobaric oxygen and air-breathing controls (p = 0.001).\n Irradiated tissue develops a hypovascular-hypocellular-hypoxic tissue that does not revascularize spontaneously.\n Results failed to demonstrate an angiogenic effect of normobaric oxygen.\n It is suggested that oxygen in this sense is a drug requiring hyperbaric pressures to generate therapeutic effects on chronically hypovascular irradiated tissue.",
