  "text": "The use of prostaglandin F2 alpha for the prophylaxis of cyclophosphamide induced cystitis in rats.\n It is well-established that cystitis is a significant cause of morbidity after cyclophosphamide administration in clinical populations.\n We induced hemorrhagic cystitis in rats using cyclophosphamide and compared controls to those pretreated with prostaglandin F2 alpha.\n Rats were then evaluated for differences in bladder weights, gross edema, gross bleeding, and histologic changes.\n The weights of the bladders which had been treated with cyclophosphamide were 94% greater than the controls.\n The weights of the bladders which were pretreated with prostaglandin F2 alpha before cyclophosphamide were only 19% greater than controls.\n Significant differences were found between cyclophosphamide controls and prostaglandin F2 alpha pretreated groups for gross weight (p less than .0005), gross edema (p less than .0005), and histology (.0005 less than p less than .005).\n We conclude that prostaglandin F2 alpha may be helpful in preventing cyclophosphamide induced cystitis.",
