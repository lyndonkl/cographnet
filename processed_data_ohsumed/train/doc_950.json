  "text": "Modulatory action of adenosine on gastric function and ethanol-induced mucosal damage in rats.\n This study examines the gastric effects of adenosine and its antagonist, theophylline, on secretory function, mucosal blood flow, and on ethanol-induced glandular mucosal damage in rats that were fasted for 24 hr before experimentation.\n The animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and their tracheae cannulated.\n An ex vivo stomach chamber then was prepared.\n The luminal bathing solution was collected every 15 min and the concentrations of H+ and Na+ were determined by a pH autotitrator and an ionmeter, respectively.\n The glandular mucosal blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter and the severity of lesions was determined by measuring the hemorrhagic areas.\n Adenosine administration (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) markedly lowered the H+ and Na+ output but increased the secretory volume and mucosal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner.\n The same doses of the nucleoside also prevented ethanol-induced mucosal damage.\n These effects were prevented by pretreatment with theophylline (30 or 60 mg/kg, subcutaneous).\n Ethanol given alone significantly depressed the H+ and Na+ secretion.\n Both effects were not modified by adenosine treatment.\n However, the depressive action of ethanol on mucosal blood flow was prevented by adenosine.\n These findings indicate that adenosine modulates the physiological function of the stomach.\n It also directly activates the defensive mechanism of the stomach, which is partially mediated by the improvement of the gastric mucosal blood flow and an increase in the nonacid component of gastric secretion.",
