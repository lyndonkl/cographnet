  "text": "What practicing physicians in North Carolina rate as their most challenging geriatric medicine concerns.\n We recently surveyed a random sample of 500 physicians in family practice, general practice, and internal medicine in North Carolina, to discover their most challenging geriatric concerns.\n Using a three-stage survey technique, respondents were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the most challenging geriatric problems they face and what specific geriatric content areas would attract their participation in an educational program.\n They were then asked to rank 34 topics on which they would like more information.\n A total of 242 responses were received for a 55% response rate (63 of the 500 were undeliverable).\n Responses indicated that physicians are more concerned with management than diagnosis and revealed considerable evidence of empathy and concern.\n The top three topics had to do with the management of dementia, multiple problems, and depression.\n Approximately 25% of physicians consider problems of financing health care as among the most challenging problems.",
