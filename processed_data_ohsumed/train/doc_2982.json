  "text": "Middle cerebral artery flow velocity waveforms in fetal hypoxaemia.\n In 81 small-for-gestational age fetuses (SGA) colour flow imaging was used to identify the fetal middle cerebral artery for subsequent pulsed Doppler studies.\n Impedence to flow (pulsatility index; PI) was significantly lower, and mean blood velocity was significantly higher, than the respective reference ranges with gestation.\n Fetal blood sampling by cordocentesis was performed in all SGA fetuses and a significant quadratic relation was found between fetal hypoxaemia and the degree of reduction in the PI of FVWs from the fetal middle cerebral artery.\n Thus, maximum reduction in PI is reached when the fetal PO2 is 2-4 SD below the normal mean for gestation.\n When the oxygen deficit is greater there is a tendency for the PI to rise, and this presumably reflects the development of brain oedema.",
