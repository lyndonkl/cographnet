  "text": "Comparison of ulcer surgery at a Veterans Administration and University Hospital.\n We compared the patient populations and outcome of surgery for peptic ulcer disease in 81 patients at a Veterans Administration Hospital (OVAH) and 97 patients at an affiliated University Hospital (UNH).\n The surgeons and choice of operation were comparable at both facilities.\n Patients were similar with respect to severity of ulcer disease, percentage of elderly patients and distribution of comorbid conditions.\n There were significantly more female patients (45% vs 2%, P less than 0.05), patients less than 40 years old (22% vs 6%, P less than 0.05), and patients with gastric ulcers (27% vs 12%, P less than 0.05) at UNH.\n Alcoholism was more prevalent at OVAH (57% vs 22%, P less than 0.05).\n Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 27 per cent and 14 per cent at OVAH and 25 per cent and 16 per cent at UNH.\n These data suggest that quality of care for surgical therapy of ulcer disease at a VA Hospital is comparable to its tertiary care affiliate with a similar patient population.",
