  "text": "Regional chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases: a phase II evaluation of targeted hepatic arterial 5-fluorouracil for colorectal liver metastases.\n The results of systemic chemotherapy in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer remain dismal.\n Regional chemotherapy has been advocated as a method of improving the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumour, while minimizing systemic toxicity.\n The use of vasoactive agents to redistribute arterial blood flow towards tumour, and of biodegradable microspheres to slow tumour blood flow, have also been suggested as methods of further improving tumour exposure to drug.\n We present 21 patients who received intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases.\n Combined treatment (angiotensin II, albumin microspheres and 5-fluorouracil) was administered 4-6 weekly, and bolus 5-fluorouracil was given in the intervening weeks.\n Toxicity was minimal.\n Responses were seen in seven patients.\n Fewer than half of the deaths were from liver metastases; a quarter of the patients died from non-cancer-related causes.\n Survival was prolonged in the treated group compared with historical controls.\n These results suggest that this regimen has activity in patients with colorectal liver metastases.",
