  "text": "Mechanical lithotripsy of common duct stones.\n Over the past 8 years we have utilized various types of mechanical lithotriptors to crush common bile duct stones.\n The procedure was performed in 93 patients with an overall success rate of 94%.\n However, because many accessories were in a developmental stage, entrapment of stones was not always possible on the first attempt, and the procedure was repeated in some patients a second or third time.\n During the interim, while awaiting another attempt at lithotripsy, cholangitis was prevented by leaving a prosthesis in place.\n A variety of lithotriptor models from different manufacturers have proven effective.\n We recommend that endoscopists use these devices to rid the bile duct of retained stones.",
