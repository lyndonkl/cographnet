  "text": "Postoperative hypertension: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, with intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride.\n Nicardipine hydrochloride, a new calcium channel blocker for intravenous use, has been compared with placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on postoperative hypertension.\n Of 175 patients who signed preoperative consent, 24 (13.7%) met entry criteria.\n Hypertension was significantly better controlled in nicardipine-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo (93% versus 30%, p less than 0.05).\n All the placebo failures were subsequently successfully treated with nicardipine.\n There were no significant complications in either group.\n The authors conclude that nicardipine HC1 is an effective, safe therapy for postoperative hypertension.\n Further studies are now indicated comparing it with other drugs currently used to treat this condition.",
