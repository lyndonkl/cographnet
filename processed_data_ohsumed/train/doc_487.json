  "text": "Helicobacter pylori infection: a simplified diagnostic approach.\n We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic finding of nodular antritis and rapid urease test (RUT) in order to simplify the approach to the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (H.\n pylori) infection.\n Forty-four consecutive patients (mean age 7.9 yr, range 6-13 yr) referred because of recurrent abdominal pain as the main symptom, were prospectively investigated for the presence of H.\n pylori.\n H.\n pylori positivity or negativity was defined as the concordance of two of the following tests: RUT, microbiologic culture, and histologic examination on bioptic samples.\n RUT sensitivity was 100%, whereas specificity was 87.5%.\n The presence of nodular antritis had a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 87.5% in H.\n pylori infection diagnosis.\n The predictivity value of combined RUT and nodular antritis, whether positive or negative, was 100%.\n Only in case of discordance do we suggest the utilization of other expensive tools for diagnosis of H.\n pylori infection.",
