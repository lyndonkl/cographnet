  "text": "Gonadoblastoma in an anatomically normal man: a case report and literature review.\n Gonadoblastoma, a rare gonadal neoplasm, presents most frequently in phenotypic female or phenotypically male patients with dysgenetic gonads or undescended testes.\n To date, only 2 cases of gonadoblastoma have been reported in anatomically normal male patients with scrotal testes.\n Both of these patients presented with testicular masses and germ cell tumors.\n We report a case of a genotypically and phenotypically normal, fertile man with descended testes who on evaluation for chronic orchialgia had a gonadoblastoma unaccompanied by a germ cell neoplasm.\n The tumor was nonpalpable and was initially discovered on scrotal ultrasound.",
