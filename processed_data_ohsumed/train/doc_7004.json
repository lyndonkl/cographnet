  "text": "Compound blue nevus: a variant of blue nevus with an additional junctional dendritic component. A clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical study of six cases.\n We studied six cases of heavily pigmented melanocytic lesions with features of blue nevi within the dermis, but with an additional junctional dendritic component.\n This compound variant of blue nevus is an uncommon lesion that has not been previously identified as a distinct histologic entity.\n Immunoperoxidase staining for S100 protein and counterstaining with azure B distinguished the presence of melanocytes among numerous melanophages within the dermis.\n The compound variant of blue nevus can be distinguished histologically from combined blue nevus, pigmented spindle cell nevus, malignant melanoma, and melanosis due to a regressed malignant melanoma.\n The six lesions were from three men and three women whose ages ranged from 11 to 51 years (mean, 31 years).\n Three lesions were located on the trunk, two on the extremities, and one on the head.\n After a mean follow-up period of 47 months (range, 38 to 58 months), there was no evidence of recurrence.",
