  "text": "Myocarditis simulating acute transmural myocardial infarction.\n A patient with cardiogenic shock had typical electrocardiographic findings of acute anterior transmural myocardial infarction.\n Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries and severe biventricular failure.\n Postmortem examination confirmed normal coronary arteries; acute myocarditis, but no evidence for infarction, was found.\n Electrocardiographic changes of myocarditis may be indistinguishable from acute transmural infarction.\n In suspected cases, cardiac catheterization should be considered prior to thrombolytic therapy.",
