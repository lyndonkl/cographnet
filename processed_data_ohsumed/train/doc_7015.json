  "text": "Primary malignant lymphoma of the bladder.\n We treated 11 patients with primary malignant lymphoma of the bladder.\n The typical patient is a woman more than 50 years old who presents with urgency and frequency of micturition, and occasionally gross hematuria.\n Hydronephrosis is present in half of the patients and cystoscopy usually reveals a solid tumor.\n Partial cystectomy, when feasible, with or without radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the usual treatment modality.\n When localized to the bladder, malignant lymphoma has an over-all favorable prognosis.",
