  "text": "Effects of alcohol on the import of aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor into rat liver mitochondria.\n We previously showed that incubation of rat liver mitochondria with alcohols resulted in the inhibition of the import of aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor but not that of ornithine transcarbamylase precursor (Wang TTY, Farres J, and Weiner H: Arch Biochem Biophys 272:440-449, 1989).\n The time required for inhibition of import to occur was now measured with ethanol (200 mM) and butanol (100 mM) at 0 degree and 30 degrees C.\n It required approximately 30 min to achieve 50% inhibition with butanol and 50 min with ethanol.\n To further substantiate the membrane perturbing effects of alcohols, we also examined the effect of oleic acid on import.\n We found that incubation of mitochondria with oleic acid (0-100 microM) resulted in inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor import in a dose response fashion.\n In addition to in vitro effects of alcohols on import, we conducted a preliminary study on import of protein into liver mitochondria isolated from rats fed ethanol.\n We found that the rate of aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor import into liver mitochondria isolated from ethanol fed rats was identical to that from control.\n The results are consistent with finding that the activity and amount of aldehyde dehydrogenase was the same in mitochondria isolated from the alcohol-fed or control animals.",
