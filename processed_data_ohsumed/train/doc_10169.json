  "text": "The association of intrapartum asphyxia in the mature fetus with newborn behavior.\n A matched cohort study of mature newborns with biochemically determined intrapartum fetal asphyxia and mature newborns with normal blood gas and acid-base assessments at delivery were studied to demonstrate the effect of fetal asphyxia on newborn behavior as expressed by the Brazelton newborn behavioral assessment scale.\n The newborn behavioral assessment scale was administered 3 days after delivery and again 2 weeks after delivery.\n The Lester newborn behavioral assessment scale summary scores for the group with asphyxia were of the same order as those in the control group.\n This was also true of the group of newborns with asphyxia with the more severe metabolic acidosis and those with low Apgar scores.\n These findings support the contention that many newborns who have undergone an intrapartum asphyxial insult will not have evidence of central nervous system injury and that the threshold of central nervous system injury is at the severe end of the spectrum of asphyxia as expressed by a metabolic acidosis.",
