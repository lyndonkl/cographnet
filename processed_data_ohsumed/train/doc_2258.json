  "text": "Cardiac disease in the alcoholic patient.\n Ethanol in acute low doses is believed to be relatively nontoxic to the normal myocardium, despite data indicating low-level contractility impairment.\n In patients with myocardial disease, or as the serum ethanol concentration is increased to high levels, angina, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia may be potentiated.\n Chronic ethanol use, at moderate doses, may be protective against coronary artery disease, despite increased rates of hypertension.\n Alcohol consumption at high doses may result in dilated cardiomyopathy and a dismal prognosis.\n Alcohol abuse is associated with increased mortality.",
