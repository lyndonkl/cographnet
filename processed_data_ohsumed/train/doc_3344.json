  "text": "Immunohistochemical study of cytokeratin expression in normal and pathologic middle ear mucosa of the rat.\n The expression of cytokeratins in the epithelium of the middle ear and external auditory meatus of the rat was studied on cryosections of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-decalcified specimens by use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies.\n The normal middle ear epithelium revealed a complex cytokeratin profile, including regional differences.\n The induction of sterile middle ear effusions resulted in increased cytokeratin expression.\n Infective effusions were accompanied by both quantitative and qualitative changes in the cytokeratin expression patterns.\n The differences observed between the cytokeratin profiles of external meatal skin and those of middle ear epithelium may form a useful tool for research into cholesteatoma development.",
