  "text": "Myocardial uptake of indium-111-labeled antimyosin in acute subendocardial infarction: clinical, histochemical, and autoradiographic correlation of myocardial necrosis.\n Indium-111-labeled antimyosin has been utilized in the diagnosis and localization of acute transmural myocardial infarction.\n The present report describes a patient who presented with a massive subendocardial infarction.\n Two days after the injection of antimyosin, the patient's clinical status markedly deteriorated and he expired.\n Postmortem examination demonstrated severe three-vessel coronary artery disease with extensive myocyte death in the endocardium.\n Autoradiography and histochemical staining of the prosected heart demonstrated high correlation for myocardial necrosis and corresponded to clinical evidence for diffuse subendocardial infarction.",
