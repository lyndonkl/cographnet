  "text": "The effect of interleukin 4 (BSF-1) on infection of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages with HIV-1.\n The effects of various cytokines were examined in an in vitro model of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM).\n Monocytes were obtained from blood of normal donors by Ficoll/hypaque gradient centrifugation and adherence.\n These cells were allowed to mature in the presence of varying concentrations of cytokines.\n After five days in culture, cells were harvested, counted, and inoculated with S5G7, an HTLV-IIIB subclone.\n The cells were replated in the presence of the same concentrations of cytokines.\n Culture supernatants were sampled over 28 days for p24 antigen (Ag) as measured by Ag capture assay.\n In repeat experiments, the following observations were made: 1.\n MDM from some donors could be infected only in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin 4 (IL-4); 2.\n The effect of GM-CSF was variable; TNF alpha also enhanced HIV replication above controls; 3.\n IL-4 was the most potent enhancer of HIV-1 replication in MDM of the cytokines tested, inducing p24 Ag levels 75-230 times those seen in control cultures run simultaneously.\n This effect was dose dependent.\n Ag production was not observed until Day 14 postinfection in most experiments.\n Multinucleated giant cell formation was observed only in the presence of IL-4.",
