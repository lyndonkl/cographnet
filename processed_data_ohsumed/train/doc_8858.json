  "text": "Simultaneous reconstruction of cervical soft tissue and esophagus with a gastro-omental free flap.\n A microvascular transfer of gastric tube and omentum was used to simultaneously reconstruct cervical soft-tissue and esophageal defects in five patients.\n All patients had previous high-dose radiation and multiple flap reconstructions.\n The largest esophageal and soft-tissue defects were 10 cm and 160 cm2, respectively.\n All wounds healed primarily except for one orocutaneous fistula.\n There was one death from an intraoperative stroke.\n The gastro-omental flap is useful in cases where the reconstructive surgeon is faced with both esophageal and soft-tissue defects--particularly in heavily irradiated patients who have few reconstructive options.",
