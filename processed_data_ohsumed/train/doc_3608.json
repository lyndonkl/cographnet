  "text": "Urogenital dysfunction after abdominoperineal resection for carcinoma of the rectum.\n The long-term urogenital dysfunctions in 46 of 104 surviving patients submitted to abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma between 1972 and 1986 were collected and assessed.\n Urinary retention was present in 41 percent of the men and 35 percent of women, while incontinence was present in 10 percent of men and 29 percent of women.\n Impotence was reported by 59 percent of the males, all sexually active before surgery.\n Dyspareunia was present in 50 percent of the women in the study.\n The possibility of treating prostatic hypertrophy concurrently with abdominoperineal resection in selected cases to avoid urinary retention is discussed.\n The limited number of responders to the survey may interfere with the global statistical significance.",
