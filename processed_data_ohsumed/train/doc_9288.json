  "text": "Pulmonary and acid-base assessment.\n With increased technology, increased patient longevity, and burgeoning health care knowledge, pulmonary assessment of clients has become more complex, and nurses are now challenged to develop more comprehensive skills.\n These include a more focused patient history on selected clients as well as careful inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.\n Additional techniques such as voice sounds provide the nurse with even more assessment data.\n An understanding of common pathologic pulmonary problems and their corresponding assessment findings as well as knowledge about acid-base imbalances will result in more effective professional nursing care.",
