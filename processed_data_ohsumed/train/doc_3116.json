  "text": "Hepatic infarction in preeclampsia.\n Two cases of hepatic infarction in toxemia of pregnancy are described.\n Both patients had associated laboratory findings of the HELLP syndrome (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet levels).\n Computed tomography (CT) showed nonenhancing low-attenuation areas varying in configuration from peripheral, well-defined, wedge-shaped lesions to larger abnormalities.\n Magnetic resonance imaging showed a corresponding area of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.\n Ultrasound showed several well-defined peripheral hypoechoic areas.\n The low attenuation and lack of enhancement on CT scans and the absence of mass effect are the key distinguishing features.",
