  "text": "Serum lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and very low density lipoprotein subfractions during 6-month fibrate treatment in primary hypertriglyceridaemia.\n Serum lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were studied in 14 hypertriglyceridaemic (HTG) patients during a 24-week period of treatment with gemfibrozil, and after a 6-week washout period.\n A marked decrease in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglyceride was observed.\n There was an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, particularly the HDL3 component.\n A slight increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed after 12 weeks, but this had almost disappeared after 24 weeks.\n The treatment resulted in an increase in serum apolipoprotein A-II levels and a reduction in serum apo C-III and apo E.\n VLDL subfractionation by density gradient centrifugation in four subfractions of decreasing size (A, B, C and D) showed a predominant reduction of the large subfractions A, B and C, while the decrease in VLDL-D was less marked.\n Percentage changes from the baseline level of VLDL-A and VLDL-D cholesterol were found to be inversely correlated with percentage changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol, respectively.\n This might reflect a transfer of cholesterol from VLDL-A to HDL, and from VLDL-D to LDL.\n The above data suggest fibrate-induced stimulation of lipoprotein lipase, and indicate that the enhanced transfer of cholesterol from VLDL to LDL, induced by fibrates in HTG patients, is less pronounced after a prolonged period of treatment.",
