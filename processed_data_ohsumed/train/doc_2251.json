  "text": "Balloon rupture due to lesion morphology during coronary angioplasty.\n We report a case of coronary angioplasty of a left anterior descending artery lesion that was complicated by the rupture of three successive balloon catheters.\n Each rupture occurred as a pinhole jet of contrast into a diagonal side branch, causing subintimal staining.\n This case demonstrates that balloon rupture may result from lesion morphology.",
