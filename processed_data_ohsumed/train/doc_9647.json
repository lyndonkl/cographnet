  "text": "Amyloidosis in saphenous vein aortocoronary bypass grafts.\n A patient in whom idiopathic amyloidosis of aortocoronary saphenous vein grafts was found at autopsy two years after myocardial revascularization due to coronary atherosclerosis is reported.\n Idiopathic generalized immunocyte derived amyloidosis extensively studied at autopsy was obviously present at the time of surgery although it remained unnoticed macroscopically in the inserted graft.\n It appears that simultaneously with arterialization further deposition and also significant redistribution of amyloid within the walls of the vein grafts additionally took place after their insertion.\n It seems interesting that in spite of the amyloidosis the grafts functioned well and were found patent two years after surgery.",
