  "text": "Clinical problems in follow-up of patients after conservative surgery and radiotherapy.\n Patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage breast carcinoma are at risk of developing an ipsilateral breast recurrence for a long period.\n Fortunately, few such patients present with an inoperable recurrence or simultaneous distant metastases.\n Salvage rates are high and may be improved by early detection.\n Although usually unambiguous, physical examination of the treated breast may reveal changes attributable to surgery and radiotherapy that can mimic a recurrent cancer.\n There also is substantial overlap in radiologic appearance between benign and malignant lesions.\n It may be necessary to perform a biopsy when there is a question of recurrence.\n Careful life-long follow-up of patients thus is a critical part of their care.",
