  "text": "Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility.\n A subfertile male with a history of left cryptorchism underwent scrotal ultrasound that revealed stippled calcifications, without associated mass, in the right testicle.\n Six months later, while on a regimen of clomiphene citrate, a testicular tumor became palpable.\n This was sonographically confirmed to be surrounding the calcifications.\n Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions.\n We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings.\n Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia.\n Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate.",
