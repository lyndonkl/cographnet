  "text": "Combined internal mammary artery graft for coronary artery revascularization.\n Five patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting with a technique involving both internal mammary arteries and a small piece of interposed saphenous vein.\n The combined internal mammary artery grafts were used for sequential grafting.\n A total of 20 anastomoses were performed (average number, 4 anastomoses per patient).\n There were no operative deaths.\n Postoperative complications included reoperation for bleeding in 1 patient and diaphragmatic dysfunction in another.\n Postoperative coronary angiography 2 days before discharge (mean time, 10 days postoperatively) revealed that all the sequential anastomoses with the combined IMA graft were patent.\n Exercise tolerance tests performed 3 and 11 months postoperatively indicated excellent results and no ischemia.\n Based on this experience, we conclude that this method appears promising for multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting.",
