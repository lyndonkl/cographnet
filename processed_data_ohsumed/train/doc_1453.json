  "text": "Mycobacterium leprae-specific T cells from a tuberculoid leprosy patient suppress HLA-DR3-restricted T cell responses to an immunodominant epitope on 65-kDa hsp of mycobacteria.\n The polar tuberculoid type (TT) of leprosy, characterized by high T cell reactivity to Mycobacterium leprae, is associated with HLA-DR3.\n Surprisingly, DR3-restricted low T cell responsiveness to M.\n leprae was found in HLA-DR3-positive TT leprosy patients.\n This low responsiveness was specifically induced by M.\n leprae but not by M.\n tuberculosis and was seen only in patients and not in healthy controls.\n We studied this patient-specific, M.\n leprae-induced, DR3-restricted low T cell responsiveness in depth in one representative HLA-DR3-positive TT leprosy patient by using T cell clones.\n From this patient two types of T cell clones were obtained: one type was cross-reactive with M.\n tuberculosis and recognized an immunodominant epitope (amino acids 3 to 13) on the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp) the other type was M.\n leprae specific and reacted to a protein other than the 65-kDa one.\n To examine whether these M.\n leprae-specific T cell clones were responsible for the DR3-restricted low responsiveness to M.\n leprae, we tested them for the ability to suppress the proliferation of the DR3-restricted, 65-kDa, hsp-reactive clones.\n The DR3-restricted, M.\n leprae-specific T cells completely suppressed the proliferative responses of DR3-restricted, cross-reactive T cell clones to the 65-kDa hsp from the same patient as well as from other individuals.\n Also, DR3-restricted responses to an irrelevant Ag were suppressed by the M.\n leprae-specific T cell clones.\n However, no suppression of non-DR3-restricted T cell responses was seen.\n Although the mechanism must still be elucidated, this M.\n leprae-induced, DR3-restricted immunosuppression may at least partly explain the observed DR3-associated low T cell responsiveness in TT leprosy patients.",
