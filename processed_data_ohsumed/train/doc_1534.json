  "text": "Detection of a human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle antigenically related to HIV.\n Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes.\n The loss of salivary and lacrimal gland function is accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration.\n Because similar symptoms and glandular pathology are observed in certain persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a search was initiated for a possible retroviral etiology in this syndrome.\n A human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle that is antigenically related to HIV was detected in lymphoblastoid cells exposed to homogenates of salivary tissue from patients with Sjogren's syndrome.\n Comparison of this retroviral particle to HIV indicates that they are distinguishable by several ultrastructural, physical, and enzymatic criteria.",
