  "text": "Laboratory tests in the follow-up of treated alcoholics: how often should testing be repeated?\n The study group consisted of 60 male and 13 female alcohol-dependent employed patients who participated in inpatient treatment for alcoholism.\n They were followed up bimonthly for eight months after the treatment period.\n The results with GGT, ASAT, ALAT, MCV and the combination of GGT and MCV were studied with respect to the effect of taking the tests once (at eight months), twice (once every four months) or four times (bimonthly).\n According to our definition, the treatment outcome was good when the laboratory test values were within the normal range during the whole follow-up period.\n The differences in observed outcome (at eight months after treatment) were small whether one took the tests once at the end of the follow-up period or up to four (i.e.\n bimonthly) times.\n Nevertheless, there were some differences between the laboratory markers.\n To get the most accurate picture of drinking during the follow-up period one should repeat the test bimonthly with ASAT or ALAT, once every four months with GGT (or combined GGT and MCV), and once after eight months with MCV.\n When the time course of relapses is important for the study the more frequent test taking is also indicated.",
