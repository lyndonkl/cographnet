  "text": "Severe mitral insufficiency post-balloon valvuloplasty: the late changes found in a disrupted mitral valve.\n The case of a 45-yr-old woman who had balloon valvuloplasty for rheumatic mitral stenosis is presented.\n An anterior mitral leaflet tear occurred as a complication of the procedure.\n Both partial healing of the anterior mitral leaflet and gradual dilatation of the left atrium occurred which allowed the damaged valve to remain in situ for several months.\n Some of the late changes which occur after such a complicated valvuloplasty are illustrated here, as this patient eventually required surgery and valve excision for definitive repair.",
