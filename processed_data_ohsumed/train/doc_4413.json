  "text": "Variceal sclerosis in schistosomotic patients: a 5-year follow-up study.\n To assess the therapeutic possibilities of injection sclerosis in schistosomotic portal hypertension, a 5-year prospective study was conducted in northeast Brazil, where this parasitosis is endemic.\n Fifty patients undergoing endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from rupture of esophageal varices from July through December 1981 were chosen for the study.\n The 32 consenting patients were submitted to injection sclerotherapy paravariceally, using ethanolamine oleate; the 18 refusing to participate were assigned to the control group.\n The incidence of rebleeding was 28.1% in the former and 44.5% in the latter, a difference which was not statistically significant (Fisher's test, p = 0.375).\n Mortality from rupture of esophageal varices was 3.1% in the sclerotherapy group and 27.7% in the control group, a statistically significant difference (Fischer's test, p = 0.017).\n Since sclerotherapy markedly improved the long-term survival rate of the patients, this procedure is advocated for the treatment of esophageal varices in cases of portal hypertension due to schistosomiasis.",
