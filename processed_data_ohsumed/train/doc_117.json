  "text": "Let's stop the comeback of tuberculosis. Best drug regimens for prevention and treatment.\n Tuberculosis has been on the increase in recent years, so physicians need to be aware of it once again.\n Very effective drugs are available to treat the disease.\n Pharmacokinetics, dosing schedule, and adverse reactions of each anti-tuberculous agent need to be considered.\n A short (6-month) course of therapy is now recommended: Isoniazid, rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), and pyrazinamide are given for the initial 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months.\n If drug resistance is a factor, a fourth drug is added to the initial regimen, and therapy may have to be extended.\n Chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid is very important to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis.\n It should be given to all high-risk persons.",
