  "text": "Osteotomy for osteoarthritis of the hip. A survivorship analysis.\n We have reviewed 368 osteotomies carried out for osteoarthritis of the hip at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.\n Survivorship analysis showed that 10 years after osteotomy 47% had required no further surgery, and even after 20 years 23% had still not had a hip replacement.\n Hips with moderate arthritic change showed significantly better results than those with more severe degeneration.\n Osteotomies with varus angulation as well as medial displacement showed longer survival.",
