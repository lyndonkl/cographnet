  "text": "Cisplatin-fluorouracil interaction in a squamous cell carcinoma xenograft.\n Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are treated with cisplatin and fluorouracil according to a schedule based on the findings of clinical studies.\n A similar schedule showed a supra-additive effect in the treatment of xenografted human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\n We sought to ascertain whether this schedule was optimal.\n A single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) was combined with three injections of fluorouracil given during a 24-hour period (total dose, 150 or 80 mg/kg) before, during, or after cisplatin administration.\n The combined effect of cisplatin and fluorouracil on tumor growth and toxic effects was schedule dependent.\n Consideration of both toxic effects and tumor growth inhibition, as assessed by reduction of the area under the growth curve, the optimal administration interval was found to be fluorouracil given 3 days after cisplatin administration.",
