  "text": "Acute bronchitis: general practitioners' views regarding diagnosis and treatment.\n A survey was conducted among 800 Dutch general practitioners to establish their views on the diagnosis and treatment of bronchitis and related disorders with reference to 12 theoretical patients.\n The answers of the 467 respondents (response rate 60%) showed no clear relationship between signs and symptoms of the patients and the diagnosis made.\n In the authors' opinion the diagnosis of pneumonia was made too often.\n The decision whether or not to prescribe an antibiotic for a coughing patient was based in part on the diagnosis made, but in part it was also made on the basis of the signs and symptoms, irrespective of the diagnosis.\n The authors have the impression that general practitioners tend to prescribe antibiotics too quickly to coughing patients.\n There is a need for guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute bronchitis and related conditions.",
