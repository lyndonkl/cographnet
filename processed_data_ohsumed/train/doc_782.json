  "text": "Ablation of the cystic duct and the gallbladder. Experimental basis and initial clinical observations.\n Bipolar radiofrequency electrocoagulation of the cystic duct by catheter can be performed safely and reproducibly using fluoroscopic control and induces endoluminal scar formation.\n The scar within the cystic duct forms a reliable barrier between the gallbladder and the biliary system and avoids recanalization of the cystic duct at a later date.\n Sclerotherapy of the isolated gallbladder with 95% ethanol and 3% STS can be performed without toxic or otherwise adverse effects and is suitable to ablate the porcine gallbladder.\n Initial clinical trials with this new technique on a small number of patients are promising and have demonstrated that the protocol can be applied safely to humans.\n The electrocoagulation technique by catheter appears suitable to ablate the human cystic duct.\n Follow-up evaluation of our first patients is under way and must determine whether our regimen is appropriate to ablate the human gallbladder on a long-term basis.\n Further development of this new approach may eventually enable definitive nonoperative treatment of cholecystolithiasis in selected patients.",
