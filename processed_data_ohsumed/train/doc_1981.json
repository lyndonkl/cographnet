  "text": "Prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio in arteriogenic impotence.\n It has been suggested that penile hypercoagulability predisposes to aging penile vascular changes and impotence, and that elevated thromboxane A2 during erection may contribute to hypercoagulability and atherosclerosis.\n Since the ratio of the prostacyclin concentration to the thromboxane A2 concentration is constantly maintained in normal hemostatic responses, an imbalance between thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin may be a factor to initiate vascular diseases and decrease blood flow.\n We assess the usefulness of the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio in penile blood during erection for diagnosis of arteriogenic impotence.\n The ratio in the arteriogenic impotence group was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than in the psychogenic and venogenic impotence groups.\n Therefore, the prostacyclin-to-thromboxane A2 ratio seems to be useful to diagnose arteriogenic impotence.",
