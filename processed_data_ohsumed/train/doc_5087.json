  "text": "Surgery for acute and chronic cholecystitis.\n Cholecystostomy and cholecystectomy remain appropriate and effective therapy for acute and chronic cholecystitis.\n Cholecystectomy is the gold standard against which all alternative methods of treatment of inflammatory biliary stone disease should be judged.\n The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of acute and chronic cholecystitis have been described.\n Techniques of cholecystostomy, cholecystectomy, and intraoperative cholangiography used by the author have been given.\n Our results and those generally described in the literature indicate that the overall mortality rate for cholecystectomy, in all age groups, is approximately 0.5%.\n This rate increases slightly in patients with acute cholecystitis and in those over the age of 65 years.\n Cholecystectomy remains the most effective and the definitive treatment for acute and chronic cholecystitis.",
