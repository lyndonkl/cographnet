  "text": "Drop attacks with Meniere's syndrome.\n We report the clinical features of 12 patients with drop attacks associated with Meniere's syndrome.\n Each described a sensation of being pushed, thrown, or knocked to the ground or a sudden illusion of movement of the environment that led to a fall.\n These episodes were not accompanied by symptoms of their typical attacks of Meniere's syndrome.\n The drop attacks occurred early and late in the course of the disease; they were the initial manifestation in 1 patient.\n In the majority the episodes spontaneously remitted, although Meniere's syndrome continued to progress.\n These attacks probably result from a sudden mechanical deformation of the otolithic membrane of the utricle or saccule due to pressure gradients within the inner ear.\n They are important to recognize because their prognosis is relatively benign compared to other causes of drop attacks.",
