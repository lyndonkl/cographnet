  "text": "Left ventricular fibroma: echocardiographic diagnosis and successful surgical excision in three cases.\n The management of three patients with left ventricular fibromas is outlined.\n All were asymptomatic children.\n Routine chest radiography suggested cardiac masses.\n M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were valuable adjuncts to conventional angiography in assessing these children.\n Electrocardiographic changes, present in all cases, were shown to regress postoperatively.\n We stress the importance of these noninvasive aids in the initial investigation and outline our operative methods of reconstruction.",
