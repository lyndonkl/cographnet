  "text": "Preventing postoperative acute bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract.\n Two hundred and ninety-eight critically ill patients at risk for the development of postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding were randomized into three groups.\n The first group comprised 85 patients who received meciadanol, a new bioflavonoid, 500 milligrams every six hours through a nasograstric tube; the second group comprised 100 patients who received sucralfate (crushed tablets), 1,000 milligrams every six hours through a nasogastric tube, and the third group comprised 113 patients who received an antacid (Maalox [magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel]) through a nasogastric tube at an initial dose of 15 milliliters every hour.\n The gastric pH was measured hourly and titrated to a pH greater than or equal to 4.0 in patients in the group receiving the antacid.\n The gastric pH was measured every two hours in the other two groups.\n Bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was determined visually (frank blood in gastric contents) or by guaiac testing.\n Bleeding occurred in seven patients receiving meciadanol, nine receiving sucralfate and six receiving the antacid.\n The difference in rates of bleeding was not statistically significant.\n Correlation between the severity of illness index and the development of bleeding was poor, at least in the low and intermediate index range.\n In contrast, there was a strong correlation between the age of the patient and the development of bleeding.\n Only one patient younger than 50 years had bleeding develop.\n Apparently, meciadanol exerts its action by a mechanism other than pH control.\n It may, therefore, fill an important gap in the ability to prevent postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding.",
