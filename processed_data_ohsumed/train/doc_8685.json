  "text": "Unintended injuries in children: the French situation.\n The French situation with respect to mortality from unintentional injuries in children is far from satisfactory.\n International comparison is made difficult by statistical bias, but although excess injury mortality is decreasing in France, rates are higher than in most advanced European countries.\n Many regulations have been enacted during the past 30 years to reduce the economic and social burden of injuries, but political will is insufficient to establish a consolidated national program and enforcement of existing legislation is inadequate.\n Evaluation of preventive and educational programs is less than optimal; many attempts have not met basic methodologic requirements.\n The situation is improving, partly because of growing social concern.\n New regulations are in preparation, but solution of this major public health problem also demands behavioral change, which is much more difficult to effect than other measures.\n Greater commitment to research, proper evaluation of sound programs, and enforcement of existing law doubtless would reduce the excess morbidity and mortality resulting from unintended injuries to children.",
