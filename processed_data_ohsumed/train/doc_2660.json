  "text": "Neurologic abnormalities in a patient with human ehrlichiosis.\n Human ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne rickettsial disease characterized by fever, headache, myalgias, anorexia, and occasionally rash.\n In our patient, changes in mental status, upper motor neuron signs, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and increased serum protein levels were found in association with serologically confirmed ehrlichiosis and were most likely due to vasculitis involving the central nervous system.\n Intraleukocytic inclusions, although observed in our case, have been infrequently found in other reported cases of ehrlichiosis.",
