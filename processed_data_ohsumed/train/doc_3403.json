  "text": "Is fibrillation chaos?\n Ventricular fibrillation is examined to determine whether it is an instance of deterministic chaos.\n Surface ECGs from dogs in fibrillation were used to generate a state space representation of fibrillation.\n Our analysis failed to identify a low-dimensional attractor that could be associated with fibrillation.\n The results suggest that fibrillation is similar to a nonchaotic random signal.\n We note, however, that such random-looking but nonchaotic behavior can also be generated by a nonlinear deterministic system.",
