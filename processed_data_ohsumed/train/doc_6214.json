  "text": "The presence of autoantibody to recombinant lipocortin-I in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n Corticosteroids may mediate some of their anti-inflammatory effects via induction of a specific 38 kDa protein, lipocortin-I.\n Anti-lipocortin-I antibodies (ALA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 23 patients with plaque-type psoriasis alone (NAP), in 21 patients with psoriasis and arthritis (PA), and in 67 healthy controls.\n Only two of 23 NAP patients had elevated ALA, whereas six of 21 PA patients had raised levels of ALA (P = 0.2).\n Sero-negative polyarthritis was the most common pattern of joint disease in those PA patients with elevated ALA (4/6).\n ALA levels did not correlate with the extent or severity of cutaneous involvement, and are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of cutaneous psoriasis.",
