  "text": "Therapy for hypercholesterolemia.\n For most patients, hypercholesterolemia can be effectively lowered with drug therapy but only after several issues have been considered.\n First, drug therapy should never be considered without adequate dietary intervention.\n Dietary therapy may be effective for many patients with mild to moderate elevations in cholesterol.\n None of the drugs used to treat lipid disorders are benign agents.\n There is still debate about the interpretations of recent studies, the ability to generalize from studies to the whole population, and the cost effectiveness of drug treatment.\n Within the framework of the AHA and NCEP guidelines, an individualized approach to therapy is prudent.\n This should be initiated with maximal patient education because drug therapy will be maintained for the long-term or for life.\n The LDL and HDL levels, age, sex, other CHD risk factors, cost of treatment, patient awareness, and motivation must all be assessed when making treatment decisions.\n When drug therapy is considered for patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, bile acid sequestrants are the drugs of choice.",
