  "text": "Coronary angioplasty of anomalous coronary arteries: notes on technical aspects.\n Five patients with significant atherosclerotic lesions of anomalous coronary arteries underwent coronary angioplasty of the anomalous vessel.\n Four patients had anomalous circumflex artery and 1 had an anomalous right coronary artery.\n Angiographic and clinical success was achieved in all 5 patients.\n To ensure adequate equipment selection special consideration should be given to angiographic characteristics of these vessels, such as the orifice configuration, exit angulation, the route the artery traverses and the location of the stenotic lesions.\n Major determinants for successful angioplasty in these patients are guiding catheter selection and advancement of the balloon catheter to the very proximal portion of the anomalous vessel to subsequently facilitate guide wire advancement.\n This data indicates that balloon angioplasty can be successfully utilized in patients with significant atherosclerotic disease of anomalous coronary arteries.",
