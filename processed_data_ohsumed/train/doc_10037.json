  "text": "Lymphomatoid granulomatosis presenting as ulcerodestructive gastrointestinal tract lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. A new association.\n We describe cases of severe odynophagia, extensive oral ulcerations, and bowel perforation in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection that were caused by lymphomatoid granulomatosis.\n Such presentations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals are usually ascribed to other causes and may be incorrectly treated on an empiric basis.\n In addition, deep tissue specimens obtained at the margin of ulcerative lesions are often necessary for definitive diagnosis.\n We review our limited treatment experience with zidovudine, interferon alfa, and H2 blockers in our patients.\n Based on the markedly increased frequency in which lymphomatoid granulomatosis is being diagnosed at our institution in the post-human immunodeficiency virus era, we postulated an association between these two entities.",
