  "text": "Ocular atopy and mycotic keratitis.\n In a retrospective analysis, we studied the association between ocular atopy and keratomycosis.\n Forty-one (26.3%) of 156 patients with fungal corneal ulcers were found to have preexisting allergic conjunctivitis.\n All patients had been using a combination of antibiotics and corticosteroids before developing the corneal ulcer.\n Fungus isolation on Sabouraud's agar medium was obtained in 74.8% (31/42) ulcers.\n The most common fungi isolated were Fusarium (32.3%) and Aspergillus (29%).\n One percent silver sulfadiazine was used as an antifungal agent in these patients.\n Overall efficacy of this drug was found to be 77.8%, with Fusarium being the most sensitive (87.5%).",
