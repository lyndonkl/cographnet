  "text": "Herniated intervertebral discs associated with unstable spinal injuries.\n To examine the occurrence of traumatic herniated intervertebral discs associated with unstable spinal injuries, the authors reviewed the records of all patients with spinal cord level unstable spine injuries managed at their institution over a 26-month period.\n Ninety-three patients were identified.\n All patients had roentgenographic and computed tomographic (CT) evaluation.\n Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 48 patients, and revealed the presence of a herniated intervertebral disc in 16, with the highest incidence being in the cervical spine.\n In the patients who had only plain film and CT scans, no disc pathology was identified.\n Magnetic resonance imaging provides a noninvasive means of examining intervertebral disc damage in unstable spinal injuries that might otherwise be unidentified and result in spinal cord injury at the time of surgery.",
