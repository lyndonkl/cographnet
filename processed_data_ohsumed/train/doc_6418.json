  "text": "The papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. An increasingly recognized clinicopathologic entity.\n The clinical course of the papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is contrasted with that of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n The former occurs predominantly in young women, has a low malignant potential, and is highly curable with surgical treatment.\n Three cases are reported that illustrate the typical clinical features and the indolent nature of the tumor.\n One case was discovered after blunt abdominal trauma resulted in rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum.\n All cases were treated by pancreatic resection with preservation of the spleen, an important consideration in younger patients.\n All patients were free of disease at long-term follow-up.\n Increasing awareness of this tumor has resulted in the reclassification of several tumors and should lead to better recognition by surgeons caring for patients with pancreatic diseases.",
