  "text": "Buccal cellulitis.\n Buccal cellulitis (BC) is an innocuous appearing infection of the cheek that is found in children and has a high incidence of concomitant bacteremia.\n Typically, the child is younger than 12 months and has a 2 to 8 hour prodrome of coryza and fever before developing the cellulitis on the cheek.\n A purplish hue on the cellulitic region is highly suggestive of Hemophilus influenzae bacteremia.\n The differential diagnosis is reviewed.\n A complete blood count, blood culture, and cellulitis aspirate culture, should be obtained on all patients with BC.\n Meningitis may be present despite the lack of meningeal signs.\n A lumbar puncture should be performed on all children at risk for bacteremic BC.\n The vast majority of these children are bacteremic and require parenteral antibiotics.\n A typical case of BC is presented and its management is reviewed.",
