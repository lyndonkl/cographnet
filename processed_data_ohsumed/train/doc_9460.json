A comparison of metabolic control, acute complications and patient preferences.\n Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple injections (MI) have been shown to have metabolic advantages in highly-selected insulin-dependent diabetics (IDDs), but there have been few comparative studies in self-selected IDDs.\n With MI, the optimal insulin preparation for overnight insulin delivery has not been defined.\n We compared conventional 2-3 injection therapy (CT), CSII and MI with human isophane insulin (MI/human isophane) and human ultralente insulin (MI/human ultralente), respectively, at bedtime in self-selected IDDs.\n Of 275 IDDs who were invited to participate, 52 individuals (18.9%) entered the study.\n Most indices of glycaemic control showed better values on CSII and also on MI compared to CT, but the differences were small.\n Fasting blood glucose was higher on MI/human ultralente than on MI/human isophane.\n Only one subcutaneous abscess and one case of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization occurred on CSII.\n Serious hypoglycaemic episodes were non-significantly increased on intensified therapy.\n Most patients clearly preferred intensified insulin therapy; approximately one half CSII.",
