  "text": "Absence of significant bacteremia during urinary catheter manipulation in patients with chronic indwelling catheters.\n The objective of this study was to quantify the microorganisms present in blood at urinary catheter removal and at reinsertion in patients with chronic indwelling urinary catheters.\n This was a prospective study during a 4-month period at a university-affiliated geriatric medical center.\n Our subjects were 33 patients with chronic indwelling urinary catheters and positive urinary cultures; the urinary catheter was usually changed once a month.\n A peripheral vein line was used for blood withdrawal and urinary cultures and quantitative blood cultures (Isolator) were performed during and shortly after urinary catheter removal and insertion.\n All patients had significant bacteriuria (greater than 10(5) cfu/mL) with an average of 2.3 microorganisms.\n Among the 46 sequential quantitative blood cultures performed, only two patients had bacteremia from the urinary source and at a very low concentration; one patient had 0.13 cfu/mL Str.\n faecalis in blood 5 minutes after removal of the urinary catheter, and the other 0.1 cfu/mL Proteus mirabilis 5 minutes after reinsertion of a new urinary catheter.\n None of the patients had any subjective or objective clinical problem during the 36 hours after the urinary manipulation.\n Clinical symptoms and bacteremia are rare events, and prophylactic antibiotics do not appear necessary during urinary catheter removal and reinsertion in elderly institutionalized patients.\n Further studies are necessary to identify risk factors in the rare instances of patients with bacteremia.",
