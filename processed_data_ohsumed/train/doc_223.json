  "text": "Cardiogenic hepatorenal syndrome.\n A variant of hepatorenal syndrome occurring in patients with chronic congestive heart failure following an episode of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in the absence of hypotension, is described.\n This was observed in 13 patients during an eleven-year period.\n The clinical picture is characterized by hepatic injury and functional renal impairment.\n Increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels as high as 2100 IU; prolongation of prothrombin time; elevation of serum bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; decrease in urinary sodium excretion; and a normal urinary sediment are the salient laboratory abnormalities of this entity.\n Treated with conventional medication, the patients' course was fatal in 4 cases.\n When the splanchnic vasodilator dopamine was added to the patients' management, 5 of 9 patients recovered.\n Cardiogenic hepatorenal syndrome is a severe but potentially reversible complication of heart failure.\n The apparently beneficial effect of low-dose dopamine needs further evaluation.",
