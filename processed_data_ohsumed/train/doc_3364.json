  "text": "Possible mechanisms limiting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor overactivation and the therapeutic efficacy of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists.\n Cytotoxic overactivation of neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal loss in hypoxia-ischemia.\n However, several events associated with hypoxia-ischemia may limit N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated injury.\n Perhaps the most important of these events is the development of extracellular acidosis.\n These limiting events may help explain why N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors contribute to injury more in focal ischemia or hypoxia in vitro than in global ischemia.",
