  "text": "Detection and direct sequencing of hepatitis B virus genome by DNA amplification method.\n Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected with amplification by the polymerase chain reaction method.\n Cloned HBV DNA equivalent to one virus genome (3 x 10(-6) pg) was detectable by ethidium bromide staining after 50 cycles of polymerase chain reaction.\n By applying this method, presence of HBV DNA was studied in 23 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 11 HBsAg-negative sera from patients with chronic liver disease.\n Hepatitis B virus DNA was positive in 8 of 8 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, in 2 of 2 HBeAg- and anti-HBe-negative, and in 12 of 13 anti-HBe-positive sera.\n Hepatitis B virus DNA was undetectable in all HBsAg-negative sera even with amplification.\n To confirm specificity, the amplified product was directly sequenced.\n Sequences around 122nd and 160th codon of HBs gene, which determines subtypes d/y and w/r, respectively, were analyzed.\n The results were compatible with recent reports regarding the relation between HBV subtypes and HBV DNA sequence at those codons.\n Hepatitis B virus DNA could be detected at the level of one virion by gene amplification method, and its sequence could be determined by direct sequencing in a few days.",
