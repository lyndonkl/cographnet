  "text": "Tuberculous peritonitis: a study comparing cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients.\n Tuberculous peritonitis is a rare disease, which often goes unrecognized because of the subtle clinical clues and its insidous onset.\n We retrospectively analyzed the records of 37 cases of tuberculous peritonitis diagnosed over a 15-year period, and compared the clinical and diagnostic features of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients.\n In cirrhotic patients, tuberculous peritonitis can simulate ascites from liver disease or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\n The diagnosis is difficult in these patients because the ascitic fluid may not be of the exudative type as a result of the low albumin level in serum, and lymphocytes do not predominate in all cases.\n Adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in ascitic fluid was elevated (higher than 40 U/L) in all 11 patients (four patients with hepatic cirrhosis).\n The time required to achieve a correct diagnosis was significantly longer in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients.\n The overall mortality was 13%, with deaths occurring exclusively among cirrhotic patients.\n We emphasize that tuberculous peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can present an atypical picture.\n A considerable element of suspicion is necessary.",
