  "text": "Pain in children.\n The assessment and management of children's pain is a topic that has received a great deal of attention since the late 1970s.\n Nurse researchers have played a dominant role in all areas of pediatric pain relief and likely will continue to do so.\n There are currently a number of pediatric pain assessment instruments developed that are used in selected practice settings, but their use should be extended to document the existence of pediatric pain and its relief.\n Pharmacologic interventions for pediatric pain relief have been hampered by incorrect beliefs about analgesic risks, prescribing and administrating habits, and a virtual explosion of information in the area of analgesics.\n Although nurses have traditionally used nonpharmacologic interventions for pain relief, these methods have not been well researched.\n Continued research efforts in this important area will result in improved diagnosis and management of pediatric pain.",
