  "text": "Intrahepatic cholesterol stones: a rationale for dissolution therapy.\n A case of primary cholesterol hepatolithiasis is reported.\n Stone composition was documented by infrared spectroscopy, and the presence of cholesterol saturated bile was demonstrated using standard biochemical techniques.\n The patient was treated with operative stone extraction, choledochoscopy, biliary enteric anastomosis, and oral dissolution therapy.\n The administration of oral dissolution agents has altered the composition of the patient's bile and may prevent further stone formation.\n We advocate the use of both stone and biliary biochemical analysis for patients with primary hepatolithiasis to facilitate optimal therapy.",
