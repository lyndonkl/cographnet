  "text": "Skin pigmentation from clofazimine therapy in leprosy patients: a reappraisal.\n Skin biopsy specimens from two lepromatous leprosy patients with dark brown pigmentation who were receiving long-term clofazimine therapy were studied.\n Ceroid-lipofuscin pigment was demonstrated inside macrophages that contained numerous phagolysosomes.\n These contained lipids and clofazimine that appeared as electron-lucent vacuoles and a lipofuscin pigment that was electron dense, granular, and lamellated.\n Although the presence of the drug in tissues contributed to the skin pigmentation, the main cause was a drug-induced, reversible ceroid lipofuscinosis.",
