  "text": "When is polypectomy sufficient treatment for colorectal cancer in a polyp?\n Eighty-seven patients with a carcinoma in a polyp were reviewed over a 12-year period.\n Ten histologic criteria were analyzed for an association with the presence of residual carcinoma.\n Four factors were identified as having prognostic value: size greater than 1.5 cm, sessility, cancer of at least 50% of the adenoma volume, and invasive carcinoma.\n Polypectomy alone is adequate treatment unless the carcinoma invades deeper to the muscularis mucosa and is associated with one or more of these characteristics.",
