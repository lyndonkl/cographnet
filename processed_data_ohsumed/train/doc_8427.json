  "text": "Removal of blunt foreign bodies from the esophagus.\n Historically, removal of blunt foreign bodies from the esophagus by esophagoscopy under general anesthesia has been considered to be relatively safe and effective.\n In recent years, alternative techniques of blind removal with balloon catheters or bougies have been advocated.\n This paper reports 246 esophagoscopies performed over a 19-year period to remove blunt esophageal foreign bodies.\n Eighty-one percent of the foreign bodies were coins and 74% were in children under 3 years of age.\n There were no deaths, no perforations, and no instances of mediastinitis.\n The only complications encountered were those due to esophageal erosion and/or respiratory problems secondary to long-standing foreign bodies.\n In the author's opinion, esophagoscopy is the best method for removal of all esophageal foreign bodies.\n There simply does not seem to be a need for alternative methods involving blind removal.",
