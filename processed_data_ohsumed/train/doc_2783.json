  "text": "Neurologic complications in chronic renal failure: a retrospective study.\n We have retrospectively examined 324 patients with chronic renal failure and evaluated the probable underlying causes of neurologic complications, laboratory data and therapeutic interventions.\n The common neurologic problems in our patients were alterations in consciousness (40.7%) and convulsions (35.1%).\n When BUN concentration was above 135 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 8 m/min/1.73 m2, alteration of consciousness was observed and when BUN concentration was 200 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 7 m/min/1.73 m2, abnormal convulsives appeared.\n Changes in deep tendon reflexes and pathologic reflexes were associated with hypertension.\n All of the patients with cortical atrophy using computerized cranial tomography aluminum hydroxide at least for 18 months, and six of them had hemodialysis.\n Fourteen patients who underwent dialysis developed convulsions and were thought to have disequilibrium syndrome.\n These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the metabolic and biochemical derangements associated with CRF may be particularly detrimental to the still developing CNS of the child.",
