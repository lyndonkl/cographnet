  "text": "Tetracyclines in urology: current concepts \n Tetracyclines have an unusually broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.\n They are generally well tolerated, with relatively few side effects compared with alternative antibiotic choices.\n Tetracyclines also compare favorably with newer antimicrobials, i.e., oral quinolones, with respect to cost and microbial resistance.\n Doxycycline's and minocycline's spectrum of antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety profile make them preferred drugs when tetracyclines are indicated in urologic infections.",
