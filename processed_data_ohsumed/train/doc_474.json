  "text": "Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy.\n We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses.\n The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.\n Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease.\n A wide resection was performed successfully.\n This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae.",
