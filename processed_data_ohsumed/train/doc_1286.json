  "text": "Emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance in nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Resistance during ciprofloxacin plus rifampin therapy for methicillin-resistant S aureus colonization.\n We initiated a randomized, single-blinded trial of ciprofloxacin plus rifampin vs sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim plus rifampin in the therapy for patients who underwent colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n Patients who were colonized with MRSA received 2 weeks of either regimen.\n The study was terminated after the enrollment of 21 subjects due to the recognition of ciprofloxacin resistance in 10 of 21 new MRSA isolates during the last 2 months of the study.\n Five of the 10 patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates had never received ciprofloxacin.\n Long-term (6-month) eradication had been achieved in only three of 11 ciprofloxacin plus rifampin and four of 10 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim plus rifampin recipients.\n The use of this new fluoroquinolone for the eradication of MRSA colonization is usually not effective and may risk the development of ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA within the hospital environment.",
