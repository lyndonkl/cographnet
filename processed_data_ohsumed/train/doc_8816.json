  "text": "Management of penile gunshot wounds.\n The management of 10 cases of penile gunshot wounds treated at Henry Ford Hospital from 1982 to 1986 is reviewed.\n All patients were assaulted by low velocity weapons (handguns).\n Eight patients had associated injuries, predominantly to the genital region (thigh, pubis, and scrotum).\n There were 5 urethral injuries; 4 were treated with primary repair, the remaining patient underwent delayed repair, complicated by severe urethral strictures requiring reoperation.\n Blood at the urethral meatus was suggestive of urethral injury but microscopic hematuria was not.\n Five penile injuries did not involve the urethra and were treated by debridement and primary wound closure with no immediate or delayed complications.\n In dealing with these injuries we recommend a high index of suspicion for urethral and regional organ injury and primary urethral closure if at all possible.",
