  "text": "Bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis versus karyotype in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of chronic myeloid leukemia.\n Karyotype and bcr/abl recombinant DNA analyses are two means of detecting the chromosomal aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia.\n The authors compared these two methods in a retrospective study of 36 patients with CML in which they found the bcr/abl DNA recombinant event in 100% (29 of 29) of those patients who had the Philadelphia chromosome.\n To achieve this sensitivity, a battery of two bcr probes and three restriction enzymes is necessary.\n The authors propose a sequential algorithm for efficient use of these probes and enzymes.\n In 76% of the patients, bcr/abl rearrangement can be detected with a Bgl II digest and a 3' commercial probe.\n An additional 21% of patients can be detected by a second assay in which the same membrane is rehybridized to a 3' and 5' combination bcr probe.\n One patient (3%) required an additional restriction enzyme digest with BamH I to detect the recombinant event by the same 3' probe.\n Karyotype analysis is used to determine cytogenetic remission in patients with CML under therapy.\n The authors studied the use of DNA analysis by the Southern blot technique to detect a decrease in the relative number of leukemic cells.\n By dilution studies and densitometric scanning of autoradiographs, the authors were able to detect a 15% decrease in the relative number of cells having the bcr/abl recombinant event.\n The authors report the preliminary results of three patients in whom they compared the karyotype and recombinant DNA analysis at multiple time points in their clinical course.\n In conclusion, the bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis is superior to karyotype for the diagnosis of CML and can be used for monitoring treated patients.",
