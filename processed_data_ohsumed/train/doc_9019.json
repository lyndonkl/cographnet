  "text": "Anti-islet cell antibodies from NOD mice.\n We produced a panel of monoclonal autoantibodies from the spleen cells of prediabetic nonobese diabetic mice.\n The antibodies were selected on the basis of their ability to bind to the surface of nondiabetic mouse islet cells, and from greater than 4000 hybridomas screened, 35 islet-reactive antibodies were isolated.\n Most of these reagents also bind to nondiabetic rat and human islet cells and beta-cell tumor lines.\n A few of the antibodies were found to be reactive with insulin.\n When tested for cross-reactivity with other cell types, most of the antibodies were found to be islet specific.",
