  "text": "Hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving remnant liver function.\n Hepatic malignancies often infiltrate to the major hepatic vein.\n Recently, we performed hepatic resection combined with hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving remnant liver function in three such patients.\n One patient had a saphenous vein graft.\n Postoperative liver function of the patients who underwent hepatic vein reconstruction was compared with those of eight patients who underwent hepatic resection of segments VII and VIII.\n The right hepatic vein in four of them was resected and in the remaining four was preserved by skeletalization using an ultrasonic aspirator.\n Although four patients with right hepatic vein resection showed severe lowering of liver function after surgery, the postoperative course of patients with preservation or reconstruction of the right hepatic vein maintained good liver function.\n Liver regeneration of three patients with hepatic vein reconstruction was good on computed tomography.\n Besides this report, to our knowledge, there is no other report of hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving the remnant liver function.\n Problems with hepatic resection combined with hepatic vein reconstruction are discussed.\n We conclude that hepatic vein reconstruction is one of the means for extending indication of the malignant tumor resection of the liver.",
