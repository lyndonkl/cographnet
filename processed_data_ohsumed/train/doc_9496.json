  "text": "Insulin-mimicking anti-idiotypic antibodies in development of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in BB/E rats.\n BB/E rats spontaneously develop a form of autoimmune diabetes resembling insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in humans.\n IDDM results from central destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreatic islets.\n Herein, we report that the outbreak of IDDM in BB/E rats is preceded by the spontaneous development of an anti-idiotypic antibody to a particular antibody to insulin made by the rats.\n This anti-idiotype, designated anti-DM-id, behaves as an antibody to the insulin-hormone receptor.\n Thus, a spontaneous anti-idiotypic antibody network whose products can affect the peripheral utilization of insulin seems to accompany the central destruction of beta-cells in developing IDDM.",
