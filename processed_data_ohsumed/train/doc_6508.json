An immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric study.\n A case of myofibroblastoma arising in the tongue of a 77-year-old man is described.\n The patient presented with a submucosal tongue mass without other associated symptoms.\n The tumor was 2 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, and composed of uniform spindle cells arranged in fascicles.\n Electron microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry demonstrated a myofibroblastic origin for the tumor cells.\n DNA flow cytometric analysis showed a diploid DNA content of this tumor.\n To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of myofibroblastoma occurring in the tongue.",
