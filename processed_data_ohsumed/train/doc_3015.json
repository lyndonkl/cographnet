  "text": "Midtrimester tubal pregnancy with markedly elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. A case report.\n Elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels have been reported to occur in a variety of pathologic conditions, including early tubal pregnancy.\n In this case, markedly elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein was associated with a midtrimester tubal pregnancy.\n The breakdown of the normal fetomaternal circulatory barrier, allowing the transplacental exchange of alpha-fetoprotein, was the likely etiology of the elevation.",
