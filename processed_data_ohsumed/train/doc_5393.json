  "text": "Biocompatibility of dialysis membranes is of no importance for objective or subjective symptoms during or after hemodialysis.\n The clinical importance of biocompatibility of hemodialysis membranes is a matter of controversy.\n The authors studied the relationship between biocompatibility and acute symptoms during hemodialysis (HD).\n Twenty-three patients underwent 12 different bicarbonate HD using Cuprophan, Hemophan, or Polyamide membranes for short (2 hr) and long (4 hr) treatments, with small or large membrane areas.\n Subjective and objective symptoms were registered during HD and 12 and 36 hours thereafter.\n Type of membrane, membrane area, or Kt/V were of no importance for the occurrence of subjective or objective symptoms.\n The patients registered fewer symptoms during 2 hr HD with high blood flow than during 4 hr HD with slow blood flow (p = 0.04).\n Headache was particularly more frequent during the 4 hr HD.\n Blood pressure, and to some extent subjective symptoms, were influenced by ultrafiltration volume but not by type of membrane.\n Biocompatibility is not a determinant of acute side effects of hemodialysis.",
