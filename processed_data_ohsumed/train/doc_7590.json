  "text": "Auditory-evoked responses in benign intracranial hypertension syndrome.\n In this study, auditory brainstem-evoked responses were conducted on 28 patients with otologic symptoms (pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, aural fullness) secondary to benign intracranial hypertension syndrome.\n Abnormalities consisting mainly of prolonged interpeak latencies were detected in one third of these patients.\n It is speculated that the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for these auditory brainstem-evoked abnormalities are stretching-compression of the cochlear nerve and brainstem caused by the intracranial hypertension and/or primary edema of the same structures due to the benign intracranial hypertension syndrome itself.\n Normalization or improvement was noticed in the majority of the patients after management.\n Since the number of patients in this study is small, it is felt that the diagnostic and prognostic value of this test needs further evaluation.",
