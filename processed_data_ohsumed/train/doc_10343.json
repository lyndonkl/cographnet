  "text": "A miniaturized vitrectomy system for vitreous and retinal biopsy.\n The author has developed a miniaturized vitrectomy system and its accessories with the size of a 23-gauge needle.\n The hand-piece can be inserted inside the eye through a Ziegler knife track.\n This instrument can be used for \"atraumatic\" removal of vitreous biopsy specimens and for removal of small pieces of retina.\n The system also seems to have application in vitreous surgery in premature infants' eyes.",
