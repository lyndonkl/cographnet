  "text": "Multiple arterial fenestrations, multiple aneurysms, and an arteriovenous malformation in a patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n We report the case of a 49-year-old, right-handed man with multiple vascular pathologies, including a fenestrated anterior communicating artery and middle cerebral artery, an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, multiple aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery, and an arteriovenous malformation.\n Diagnoses were made through computed tomography, cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative dissection.\n The lesions were managed surgically in stages with satisfactory results.\n Congenital and hemodynamic factors may have combined to manifest in the anomalies present in this unique case.\n We believe that no similar combination of vascular pathology has been reported previously.",
