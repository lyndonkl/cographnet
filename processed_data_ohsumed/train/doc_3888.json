  "text": "Assessment of patient laboratory data in the acutely ill.\n Laboratory test results are a valuable source of information.\n Nurses need to assess laboratory test results as part of the physical assessment of their patients.\n Comparison of laboratory test results and changes with abnormal physical findings provides the basis for changes in the nursing care plan.\n Progressive monitoring of laboratory results and prompt interventions might lessen the seriousness of the health problem.\n In acute care units, the initial group of laboratory tests serves as a baseline for assessing additional test results.\n Several reference values should be remembered, particularly the electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and calcium), glucose, BUN, creatinine, and albumin.\n Specific group profiles assist in identifying and in monitoring the patient's health status.\n Incorporating laboratory test results into the plan and evaluation of care will result in safer and more effective patient care.\n Referring to laboratory test findings and comparing them with physical assessment findings are required for the delivery of professional nursing care.",
