  "text": "Absence of angiogenesis-inhibitory activity in aqueous humor of diabetic rabbits.\n We studied inhibitory activity of angiogenesis in the eye to explore the formation of new blood vessels in diabetic microvascular diseases.\n When we examined the effects of extracts from various ocular tissues of nondiabetic rabbits on the proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial cells, potent inhibitory activity was found in lens and aqueous humor.\n Aqueous humor inhibited both angiogenesis on chorioallantoic membrane in vivo and promotion of endothelial cell growth in vitro, which were induced by retinal extracts.\n However, in diabetic rabbits, aqueous humor lost the ability to inhibit the growth of endothelial cells.\n The loss of activity became evident 1 mo after the alloxan injection and lasted while the animals were hyperglycemic.\n In addition, diabetic aqueous humor failed to suppress retinal extract-induced angiogenesis promotion and endothelial cell growth.\n The absence of the inhibitory activity of angiogenesis in diabetic aqueous humor might be involved in promotion of neovascularization in diabetic ocular disease.",
