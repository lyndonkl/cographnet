  "text": "The management of the painful first metatarsophalangeal joint in the older patient. Arthrodesis or Keller's arthroplasty?\n We report a prospective randomised trial comparing Keller's arthroplasty and arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for the management of symptomatic hallux valgus and hallux rigidus in the older patient.\n In 81 patients (110 feet), with a minimum of two years follow-up, both procedures gave a similar degree of patient satisfaction and symptom relief.\n The incidence of metatarsalgia was also similar.\n As there were no obvious advantages to arthrodesis, and since six out of 50 arthrodesed toes required revision, we suggest that Keller's arthroplasty is the better operation in these patients.",
