  "text": "Mefloquine kinetics in cured and recrudescent patients with acute falciparum malaria and in healthy volunteers.\n Mefloquine pharmacokinetics were compared in a randomized clinical trial in Thailand among patients with malaria and healthy volunteers.\n A single oral dose of 1500 mg mefloquine hydrochloride was administered to 11 patients and 5 volunteers and 750 mg was given to 16 patients and 5 volunteers.\n Efficacy was 82% for 1500 mg and 63% for 750 mg.\n In cured patients taking 750 mg mefloquine, peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were significantly greater than in the patients for whom treatment failed (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively), and plasma mefloquine levels were significantly higher from 8 hours to 18 days after treatment.\n Mefloquine AUC was reduced and variable in the presence of diarrhea.\n Compared with noninfected volunteers, clinically ill patients displayed a delayed time to reach peak concentration (p less than 0.01) and significantly higher mefloquine plasma levels in the first 2 days after administration of either the 750 mg or the 1500 mg dose.\n Mefloquine AUC was similar in patients with malaria and healthy volunteers.\n Because plasma levels increased in temporal relationship with clinical illness, mefloquine volume of distribution or clearance (or both) was reduced during the acute phase of illness.",
