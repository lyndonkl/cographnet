  "text": "Laparoscopic ventrosuspensions. A review of 72 cases.\n Laparoscopic ventrosuspension is simple to perform after diagnostic laparoscopy.\n Serious postoperative complication is unlikely.\n However, patient follow-up over 6 months has not confirmed the usefulness of laparoscopic ventrosuspension in the management of deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain in association with a retroverted uterus.\n The success rate of laparoscopic ventrosuspension at 6 months varies from 18.6% to 46.5%.\n The prior use of a Hodge pessary does not predict the success of laparoscopic ventrosuspension.",
