  "text": "Anatomic correlations of the long-axis views in biplane transesophageal echocardiography.\n The number of views obtainable during transesophageal echocardiography (TE) has been limited by the fixed position of the transducer at the end of the probe.\n This has confined standard TE studies to short-axis tomography of the heart and aorta.\n Recently, a biplane TE probe has become available that is capable of both long- and short-axis imaging.\n This study prospectively assessed the application of the long-axis plane of the biplane probe in providing complementary long-axis views in ambulatory patients.\n Six standard long-axis views could be obtained and were compared with corresponding anatomic sections to illustrate anatomic relations and facilitate structure identification.\n The long-axis views provide a better appreciation of the 3-dimensional nature of cardiac anatomy and function, especially in demonstrating the relation of vertically aligned structures.",
