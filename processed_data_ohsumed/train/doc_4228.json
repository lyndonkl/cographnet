  "text": "Pancreatogastrostomy: a safe drainage procedure after pancreatoduodenectomy.\n The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of pancreaticogastrostomy as an alternative method of restoring pancreaticointestinal continuity after pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n Since 1975, 45 patients have undergone pancreaticogastrostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution.\n Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed for pancreatic carcinoma (24 patients), ampullary carcinoma (8 patients), duodenal carcinoma (4 patients), common bile duct carcinoma (4 patients), pancreatic islet cell carcinoma (1 patient), trauma (1 patient), extensive colon carcinoma (1 patient), chronic pancreatitis (1 patient), and gastroduodenal artery aneurysm (1 patient).\n There was one operative death, for an overall operative mortality rate of 2%, and seven patients had major postoperative complications, for an overall morbidity rate of 15%.\n No pancreatic anastomotic leaks or other complications related to the pancreaticogastrostomy occurred.\n Twenty-four patients have died of recurrent carcinoma, with a mean survival of 25 months (range, 5 to 66 months), and 20 patients are alive and well, with a mean follow-up of 27 months (range, 2 to 106 months).\n Eight of these patients are alive 2 or more years after operation and four do not have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\n This experience confirms that pancreaticogastrostomy is a safe method of pancreatic drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy and suggests that it may have technical advantages and therefore merits more widespread application.",
