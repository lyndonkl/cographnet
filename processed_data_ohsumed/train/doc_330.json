  "text": "Role of small calibre chest tube drainage for iatrogenic pneumothorax.\n A 2 mm Teflon catheter was used as a chest tube in 28 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax.\n Frequent aspirations through the catheter were performed in 16 of the patients.\n In the remaining 12 patients the catheter was connected to a one way flutter valve.\n The treatment was successful in 27 of the 28 patients--one patient required a large calibre chest tube.\n The mean drainage time was 48 hours.\n The small catheter technique is superior to the use of a large intercostal drain as it is much less traumatic and troublesome.\n The small calibre chest tube with a one way valve is recommended as a safe and easy technique.",
