  "text": "Doppler umbilical artery studies in the twin-twin transfusion syndrome.\n Eleven patients with twin pregnancies were identified as having twin-twin transfusion syndrome on the basis of like-sex twins with monochorionic placentation and umbilical venous blood hemoglobin differences exceeding 50 g/L at delivery.\n Umbilical artery velocity-time waveform studies had been performed in these pregnancies as part of a large series of 456 twin pregnancies.\n In all 11 cases, the systolic-diastolic (S-D) ratio differences between the twins were less than 1 unit (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2), indicating that in twin-twin transfusion, umbilical artery S-D ratios are concordant even in the presence of discordancy in fetal size.",
