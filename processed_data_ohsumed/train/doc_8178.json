  "text": "Contact dermatitis from acrylate and methacrylate compounds in Lowicryl embedding media for electron microscopy.\n This report is about occupational contact dermatitis found in 3 out of 6 workers of a chemistry laboratory using Lowicryl embedding media, which contain (meth)acrylate monomer mixtures of known composition.\n The notation (meth)acrylates is used to refer to both acrylates and methacrylates.\n (Meth)acrylate monomers will polymerize in the absence of oxygen when induced by metal ions, peroxides, heat or ultraviolet light.\n The monomers are of low viscosity and remain in the liquid state at temperatures far below 0 degree C.\n The volatile compounds, some of which exhibit a most pungent odour, have a tendency to penetrate all tissue and to permeate into the finest fissures, a property which makes them suitable as sealants, glues, embedding material, etc.\n This and their toxicity may represent a danger to the health of individuals who need to work with them, especially if no precautions are taken.\n We show with patch testing that one patient reacted strongly to the compound 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate at the dilutions tested (0.5 and 1% v/v), but not at all to 10 other (meth)acrylates.\n In the same test, 3 volunteer controls were negative to 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate.\n We demonstrate that at maximum working concentration, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate penetrates both latex and vinyl gloves and elicits irritant/allergic reactions on the patient and irritant reactions on a control.\n Finally, we discuss the necessary protective measures.",
