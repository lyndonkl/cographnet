  "text": "Hypothermia and acidosis worsen coagulopathy in the patient requiring massive transfusion.\n Massive transfusion may cause abnormalities of electrolytes, clotting factors, pH, and temperature and may occur in a scenario of refractory coagulopathy and irreversible shock.\n Identification of correctable variables to improve survival is complicated by the interplay of this pathophysiology.\n Temperature may be an under-appreciated problem in the genesis of coagulopathy.\n In vitro studies have demonstrated that platelet function and vascular response are critically temperature-dependent.\n We reviewed the records of 45 trauma patients without head injury or co-morbid medical illness who required massive transfusions.\n The mean Injury Severity Score was 55 +/- 6, a mean of 22.5 +/- 5 units of blood was transfused, and mortality was 33%.\n Nonsurvivors were more likely to have had penetrating injury (88% versus 55%), received more transfusions (26.5 +/- 9 versus 18.6 +/- 1, p less than 0.05), had lower pH (pH 7.04 +/- 0.06 versus 7.18 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05), had lower core temperature (31 +/- 1 degree C versus 34 +/- 1 degree C, p less than 0.01), and had a higher incidence of clinical coagulopathy (73% versus 23%).\n Severe hypothermia (temperature less than 34 degrees C) occurred in 80% of the nonsurvivors and in 36% of survivors.\n Patients who were hypothermic and acidotic developed clinically significant bleeding despite adequate blood, plasma, and platelet replacement.\n Avoidance or correction of hypothermia may be critical in preventing or correcting coagulopathy in the patient receiving massive transfusion.",
