  "text": "Objective tocodynamometry identifies labor onset earlier than subjective maternal perception.\n The ability of women instructed in self-detection of uterine contractions to identify the abrupt rise in uterine activity known to precede the onset of labor has not been evaluated.\n This study was designed to assess the temporal relationship between objective uterine activity monitoring, subjective maternal perception of uterine activity above a commonly used threshold value (four or more contractions per hour), and progressive cervical change.\n Daily tocodynamometry (7-9 AM) was recorded in 79 women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes from admission until the onset of spontaneous labor (5.3 +/- 6.3 days).\n The subjects were at bed rest, received no tocolytic therapy, and were instructed in the signs of labor and uterine self-palpation.\n Patients simultaneously provided a subjective assessment of uterine activity (four or more contractions per hour).\n The majority of uterine activity recordings (78%) revealed fewer than four contractions per hour, and the patients' subjective reports agreed in almost all instances (97.6%).\n On 91 days, four or more contractions per hour were recorded objectively, but the patients' subjective reports agreed in only 25 instances (27%).\n On the day of labor onset, significantly more women had an objective assessment (32%) (P less than or equal to .01).\n Patients subjectively identified labor onset 10.6 +/- 6.7 hours after objective monitoring indicated increased uterine activity, and when subjectively identified, both cervical dilatation (4.9 +/- 2.5 cm) and effacement (85 +/- 30%) were significantly advanced (P less than or equal to .001) compared with the admission examination (1.1 +/- 1.2 cm; 20 +/- 30%).",
