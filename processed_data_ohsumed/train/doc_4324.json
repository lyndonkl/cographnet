  "text": "Urinary tract re-functionalization after long-term diversion. A 20-year experience with 177 patients.\n From 1969 to 1990, previously diverted urinary tracts were 'undiverted' in 177 patients whose ages ranged from 1 to 31 years.\n Fifty-six of the patients (32%) had been diverted for 10 years or longer.\n There were 67 female and 110 male patients.\n Forty-four patients had only one kidney and in two of those patients it was a previous renal transplant.\n One patient was anephric at the time of reconstruction, having had two unsuccessful transplants.\n Most of the diversions had been considered permanent.\n Types of diversions that were reversed include ileal loop, colon conduit, loop ureterostomy or pyelostomy, end ureterostomy, cystostomy or vesicostomy, long-term nephrostomy, and ureterosigmoidostomy.",
