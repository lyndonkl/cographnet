  "text": "Cardiovascular anomalies associated with prenatal exposure to theophylline.\n Theophylline has been shown to be a potent cardiovascular teratogen in animals, but there has been no evidence linking theophylline with congenital anomalies in infants.\n The cardiovascular anomalies in our three patients were aortic anomalies, double-outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and hypoplasia of the left ventricle.\n Some of these rare defects were also induced frequently in animal experiments with theophylline, which suggests that this drug can be a cardiovascular teratogen in a susceptible human fetus.",
