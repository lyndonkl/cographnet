  "text": "Inherited mouse mutations as models of human adnexal, cornification, and papulosquamous dermatoses.\n Nearly 100 mouse mutations have been described as causing some type of abnormality of the skin or hair.\n As only a few of these mutations have been studied in detail, they remain an untapped resource for furthering knowledge of basic cutaneous physiology and understanding the pathophysiology of analogous diseases in humans.\n Several diverse murine mutations are discussed.\n These include \"asebia,\" a mildly hyperkeratotoic disorder with sebaceous gland hypoplasia; \"ichthyosis,\" an example of abnormal hair growth associated with hyperkeratosis; \"rhino\" and \"hairless,\" two related examples of congenital follicular malformations; and \"flaky skin\", a potential animal model of eruptive psoriasis.",
