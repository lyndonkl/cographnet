  "text": "Current report--HIV. AIDS at the crossroads: a report from the 1990 International Conference on AIDS--San Francisco.\n Major scientific and clinical breakthroughs in HIV disease are rarely saved for the International Conference on AIDS.\n Nevertheless, this conference provides an opportunity for experts, providers, and patients to gain new information, exchange ideas, and assess progress.\n The Conference is also a public forum for political and social discussion and serves as a barometer of scientific and social trends as well.\n This year's conference featured refinements in clinical care, a deeper understanding of the epidemiologic trends, and a public awareness of the many political aspects of the AIDS epidemic.\n Contributions from family physicians and other primary care providers about problems they face and the family aspects of HIV need still greater prominence and exposure.\n Hopefully family physicians will use their expertise and report at future international conferences.",
