  "text": "Influence of phosphatidylcholine on ultrafiltration and solute transfer in CAPD patients.\n Fifteen patients (mean age 59.9 +/- 16.1 years) treated by CAPD for a mean of 21.6 +/- 14 months, underwent peritoneal clearances before and after 15 days of intraperitoneal phosphatidylcholine (PC) treatment (50 mg/L).\n No difference was observed in urea, creatinine, uric acid, and reverse dextrose clearances.\n A statistically significant increase in phosphate clearances (4 and 6 hr dwell times) (1.36%) and a reduction in drainage volume (2 hr dwell time) (1.36%) were observed after treatment.\n Urine output and percent dextrose reabsorption were unchanged.\n The ultrafiltration (UF) showed a tendency to increase, which lasted for 15 days after discontinuation of treatment.\n This tendency allowed the patients to reduce, during the same period, the amount of hypertonic solution (23.8 L vs.\n 21.3 L) required.\n The tendency to increase UF over time deserves further study.",
