  "text": "Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole.\n Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci.\n Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective.\n However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy.\n We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously.\n We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.",
