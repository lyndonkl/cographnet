  "text": "Current management of varicoceles.\n In spite of all that has been written about the varicocele, it is still not clear who will benefit from occlusion of the spermatic vein or why improvement in semen takes place in some patients but not in others.\n Because fertility is usually assessed in the framework of a couple who are trying to establish a pregnancy, it is important to evaluate both partners before making any recommendations regarding therapy.\n If the man is found to have a varicocele and semen analyses that indicate deficits in either the quantity or quality of the sperm, surgical ligation or transvenous occlusion should be considered as one appropriate form of therapy.\n Varicocele ligation and embolotherapy both can be performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal morbidity and equal effectiveness regarding pregnancy outcome.\n The cost, if the procedures are done in an outpatient facility, should be approximately equal.\n The obvious benefits of the percutaneous technique are a slightly lower recurrence rate and a more rapid return to full physical activity.\n The surgical procedure described by Marmar and associates appears to have a similar rate of recurrence and short postoperative period of recovery.\n Greater experience by more urologists using this technique needs to be gained to compare it adequately with the other methods described.\n Varicocele ligation by the inguinal or retroperitoneal routes is familiar to most urologists and does not require the operating microscope or other special instruments.\n With greater understanding of the venous anatomy and with careful dissection, the persistence and recurrence rate can be acceptably low and the postoperative recovery relatively rapid and smooth.",
