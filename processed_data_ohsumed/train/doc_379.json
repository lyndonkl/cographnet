  "text": "Trapped-lung syndrome after cardiac surgery: a potentially preventable complication of pleural injury.\n A case of trapped-lung syndrome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is presented.\n A significant pleural injury occurred during the bypass operation resulting in intrapleural hemorrhage, pleural fibrosis, and trapped-lung syndrome.\n The physicians caring for the patient when she was first seen with the trapped-lung syndrome were unaware of the potential relationship between the two prior bypass surgeries to this pulmonary complication.\n Recognition of the potential for pleural injury to occur after cardiac operations is important and may allow for earlier diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapeutic interventions.\n Early recognition and treatment with pleural fluid drainage and reexpansion of the collapsed lung may help prevent this potentially serious pleuropulmonary complication from occurring.\n In addition, the presentation of this pleuropulmonary complication may be delayed after the cardiac surgery, making early diagnosis more problematic.",
