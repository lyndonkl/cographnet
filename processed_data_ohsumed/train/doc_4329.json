  "text": "Serum acute phase proteins after orthotopic liver transplantation.\n Acute phase proteins were measured in six patients before liver transplantation and for 72 h after orthotopic liver transplantation.\n The ability of the donor liver to mount an acute phase response was demonstrated, although the response was less than that seen in other groups of patients in whom this has been studied.\n Because of the reduced response to stress, the value of these measurements as indicators of liver function in this group of patients is limited.",
