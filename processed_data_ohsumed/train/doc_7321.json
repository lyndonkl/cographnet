  "text": "Complications associated with limb salvage for extremity sarcomas and their management.\n A retrospective clinical review of 100 consecutive patients with extremity sarcomas managed by limb salvage operations was performed to evaluate local tumor control and morbidity.\n The mean follow-up period was 45.1 months.\n Overall survival was 86%.\n There were local recurrences in 3% of patients, and 26 complications in 22 patients.\n Wound necrosis was the most frequent complication.\n Failure of allogeneic bone graft operations occurred in 25 patients.\n Most of the complications were salvageable without loss of limb.\n Limb salvage is an acceptable surgical treatment of extremity sarcomas based on adequate local control and minimal morbidity.",
