  "text": "Activity of type 1 erythrocyte complement receptors in uremia and after renal transplantation.\n The effect of uremia on the activity of the erythrocyte complement receptors type 1 (CR1), and the changes occurring after renal transplantation, were studied.\n The complement receptor activity was measured by immune adherence utilizing a rosette technique.\n Patients with terminal kidney failure on the hemodialysis program exhibited significantly lower values of the erythrocyte CR1 activity in comparison with healthy controls.\n The circulating immune complexes did not affect erythrocyte CR1 activity.\n After successful renal transplantation, irrespective of the immunosuppressive program used, a significant increase in erythrocyte CR1 activity appeared, similar to control group values.\n However, the activity of erythrocyte CR1, in the graft recipients under cyclosporin A treatment, was significantly higher than in the patients receiving azathioprine with prednisone.\n Therefore, it is possible that cyclosporin A, transported in the erythrocytes, modifies the complement receptor function.",
