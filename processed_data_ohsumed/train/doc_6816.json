  "text": "Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses.\n The purpose of this article is to alert clinicians to a new pathogenic fungus of the paranasal sinuses called Exserohilum rostratum.\n Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi.\n This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis.\n To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum.\n The diagnostic workup includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by direct microscopic examination of tissue biopsy specimens.\n A craniotomy followed by a bilateral external ethmoidectomy was necessary for complete extirpation of the infected mucoceles.\n Aggressive surgical management of this mycotic infection is described.",
