  "text": "Patency rate of implantable devices during long-term intraarterial chemotherapy.\n Intraarterial implantable drug delivery systems have been considered as an alternative method for treating patients with unresectable liver malignancies.\n However, catheter problems with external implanted devices have resulted in limited application of chemotherapy.\n The introduction of subcutaneous devices offers an opportunity for long-term locoregional chemotherapy.\n Twelve external intraarterial catheters were implanted into 12 patients and 52 subcutaneously placed devices into 51 patients, all with various hepatic malignancies.\n Retrospective analyses comparing those two intraarterial systems were conducted taking into account the function and complication rate (hepatic artery thrombosis, infection, leaking, hemorrhage, and dislocation).\n The follow-up time for the external system was two to eight months (median five weeks), the thrombosis rate 33.3%, and the infection rate 25%.\n One instance of severe bleeding from the hepatic artery occurred during chemotherapy.\n One catheter dislocated.\n For the subcutaneously implanted intraarterial devices the follow-up time was five to forty-one months (median sixteen months), the thrombotic complication rate 17.3%, and the infection rate 7.6% (all patients with simultaneous bowel surgery).\n Catheter dislocation one year later required reimplantation; in 1 patient therapy had to be discontinued because of a catheter leak.\n The overall function rate was 71.3% with a median follow-up time of eight months.\n Anticoagulation therapy for subcutaneously implanted devices starting from the beginning of intraarterial chemotherapy is recommended to achieve long-term patency.\n No implantation should be preformed simultaneously with bowel surgery.\n The subcutaneously placed intraarterial devices had a higher function rate and were available for a longer period as compared with external implanted catheters.",
