  "text": "Comparison of cilofungin and amphotericin B for therapy of murine candidiasis.\n We compared the efficacies of cilofungin and amphotericin B treatment in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis.\n Three different dosages of each drug plus controls were evaluated.\n Statistically improved survival was noted only among mice treated with 1 mg of amphotericin B per kg of body weight (P less than 0.05).\n While all amphotericin B regimens and the two lower-dosage cilofungin regimens significantly reduced yeast cell counts in kidneys compared with the controls, the amphotericin B-treated mice had a significantly higher percentage of sterile kidneys following therapy compared with those treated with cilofungin (P = 0.0001).",
