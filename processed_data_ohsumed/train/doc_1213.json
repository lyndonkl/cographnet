  "text": "Hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and active gastritis.\n We report two cases of patients with 3-yr histories of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and active chronic gastritis.\n Biopsies retrospectively stained with Giemsa revealed the persistent presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in gastric biopsies of both patients throughout the 3 yr.\n After treatment with amoxicillin and bismuth subsalicylate, both became asymptomatic, one demonstrating disappearance and recurrence of the gastric polyps in conjunction with the HP.\n These cases demonstrate 3 yr of hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with HP and active gastritis.",
