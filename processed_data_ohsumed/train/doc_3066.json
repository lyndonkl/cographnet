  "text": "Failure to prevent preterm labour and delivery in twin pregnancy using prophylactic oral salbutamol \n A double blind, controlled study was performed to see whether the use of prophylactic oral salbutamol would reduce the incidence of preterm labour in twin pregnancy.\n Of the 144 women studied, 74 took salbutamol and 70 placebo.\n No difference was found in the length of gestation, birthweight or fetal outcome, although fewer babies suffered from respiratory distress syndrome in the salbutamol group.\n Women did not experience troublesome side-effects from salbutamol.",
