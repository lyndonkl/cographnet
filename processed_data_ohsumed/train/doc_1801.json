  "text": "Percutaneous popliteal approach for angioplasty of superficial femoral artery occlusions.\n Angioplasty using the percutaneous popliteal approach was utilized in 50 patients (PTS) to recanalize 59 occluded superficial femoral arteries which had been unsuccessfully canalized by using the antegrade approach because of either a flush origin occlusion or inability to maintain the guide wire in the true lumen.\n All PTS had claudication; 8 had rest pain; 3 had non-healing ulcers.\n The laser Probe was used in 17 cases and the Rotablator in 3 cases.\n Occlusion length varied between 1 and 40 cm: 7 lesions were less than 10 cm (group 1); 9 were between 10 and 20 cm (group 2); and 43 were greater than 20 cm (group 3).\n An angiographic success was obtained in 48/59 lesions (81%): 14/16 (87%) in groups 1 and 2 and 34/43 (79%) in group 3.\n Three PTS needed complementary common femoral endarterectomy and one required percutaneous aspiration of a thromboembolus.\n Complications included: arterial perforation and/or dissection (without clinical sequelae) in 11 and a popliteal hematoma in 1 PT.\n One patient with a severely ischemic leg underwent successful emergency vascular surgery, while another limb salvage patient required below-knee amputation.\n There was no worsening of limb ischemia from any popliteal approach attempt.\n At discharge, 39 patients (78%) whose outcome would have been unsuccessful with the traditional antegrade approach were clinically improved after utilizing the popliteal approach to achieve a successful angioplasty procedure.",
