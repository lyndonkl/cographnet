  "text": "Differences in knowledge of and risk factors for AIDS between Hispanic and non-Hispanic women attending an urban family planning clinic.\n Risk factors for AIDS, contraceptive use, seroprevalence of HIV, and level of knowledge before and after an AIDS education session were assessed for 657 clients attending a family planning clinic in Los Angeles, USA.\n History of a partner who was bisexual, an intravenous drug user, or a blood transfusion recipient were the most common risk factors.\n Spanish speakers reported fewer traditional risk factors than English speakers.\n They were also less likely to report a history of drug or alcohol use or sexually transmitted diseases, and to have had fewer sexual partners.\n Less than one-third of the women identified as being at risk of exposure were using condoms.\n None of 351 consecutive patients tested for HIV antibodies was positive.\n English speakers scored higher on both pre- and post-tests of knowledge about AIDS.\n Cultural factors may lower the personal risk of HIV exposure for Spanish-speaking women, but lack of knowledge about AIDS and partner behavior may increase risk.",
