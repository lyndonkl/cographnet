  "text": "Identification of the driver in two-rider motorcycle accidents. Inguinal contusion-laceration as an indication of the driver.\n In motorcycle accidents involving two riders, medicolegal identification of the driver is necessary when one or both riders die.\n It is particularly important in the latter case, because the survivor almost always insists that he or she was not driving.\n One characteristic injury that distinguishes the driver from the passenger is inguinal contusion-laceration (accompanied internally by pelvic fracture).\n This injury, caused by collision of the pelvis with the fuel tank, identifies the driver.",
