  "text": "Campylobacter pylori interactions with gastric cell tissue culture.\n Many investigators have reported that gastric mucosal biopsies of patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease show the presence of Campylobacter pylori in a large majority of cases.\n Histologic examinations of such tissues indicate a close approximation of C.\n pylori with gastric surface epithelial cells.\n A recent report has described both adherence and cell invasion of gastric cells by C.\n pylori.\n Using a transmission electron microscope, we have examined the interaction between C.\n pylori, C.\n jejuni, and E.\n coli in vitro with a gastric cancer cell line, Kato III.\n Our results indicate marked toxicity of E.\n coli and moderate toxicity of C.\n jejuni for Kato III cells.\n C.\n pylori had only a minor effect on tissue culture viability.\n C.\n pylori was found to have a strong association with the Kato III cell membranes and evidence of occasional cell invasion.\n Both C.\n jejuni and E.\n coli showed no attachment or association with the Kato III cells.\n We interpret these findings as indicating that C.\n pylori may have a specific adhesion for gastric cells.",
