  "text": "Physical examination and echo Doppler study in the assessment of femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization.\n Femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization have been well recognized.\n The development of an inguinal mass in these patients can represent a simple hematoma, a pseudoaneurysm, or an arteriovenous fistula.\n The utility of the physical examination in diagnosing these complications was assessed by using the echo Doppler study for comparison.\n This study shows that any single clinical sign should not be used in isolation, but a constellation of physical findings can suggest the correct diagnosis.",
