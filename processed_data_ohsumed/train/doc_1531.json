  "text": "Giant enterocystoma within an infant's tongue.\n A rare developmental cyst within the tongue and submandibular triangle of a male infant containing heterotopic gastric and intestinal epithelium (enterocystoma) is described and its derivation discussed.\n This cyst was of such a size as to cause feeding difficulties and partial airway obstruction during sleep.\n Following C.T.\n scanning, total obstruction necessitated an emergency tracheostomy.\n Successful enucleation via a median labiomandibulotomy was performed without further complication and two years later there is no sign of recurrence.",
