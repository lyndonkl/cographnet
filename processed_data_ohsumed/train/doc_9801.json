  "text": "Cytomegalovirus in the setting of infection with human immunodeficiency virus \n Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has several possible roles in the pathogenesis of AIDS.\n CMV causes a number of clinical syndromes, including retinitis, pneumonitis, and gastroenteritis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).\n In addition, CMV may potentiate the cellular immunodeficiency observed in patients with HIV infection either directly or through enhancement of HIV replication.\n Finally, CMV may predispose the host to bacterial or fungal infection by compromising the integrity of mucosal barriers to infection.\n Therapy with ganciclovir for CMV infection may result in a decrease in morbidity related to the virus, but problems with drug toxicity and resistance to the agent mandate the development of additional therapeutic approaches.",
