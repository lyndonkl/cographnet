  "text": "Renal autotransplantation in children: a successful treatment for renovascular hypertension.\n Renovascular hypertension in children is not a common disease.\n With improved surgical technique the incidence of nephrectomy has decreased and renovascular reconstruction is currently the preferred method to manage this entity.\n Between 1977 and 1988, 21 patients with renovascular hypertension were treated at our hospital: 7 patients 6 to 16 years old underwent renal autotransplantation.\n Of the children 4 had unilateral and 3 had bilateral disease requiring bilateral autotransplantation.\n Autotransplantation was performed by anastomosis of each renal artery end-to-side to the common iliac artery.\n The renal veins were anastomosed end-to-side to the common iliac veins.\n The ureters were left intact in all but 1 patient who required a bench operation.\n Of the 4 patients who had a unilateral procedure 3 are cured and 1 is improved with a normal blood pressure on a small dose of antihypertensive medication.\n The 3 patients with bilateral autotransplants are cured.\n These results, with normalization of the blood pressure in 86% of the patients and improvement in blood pressure in 14% with a patency rate of 87%, are similar to other reported reconstructive modalities in children.",
