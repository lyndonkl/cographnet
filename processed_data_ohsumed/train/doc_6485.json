  "text": "Parosteal osteosarcoma. Treatment by wide resection and prosthetic replacement.\n We have reviewed 20 cases of parosteal osteosarcoma treated by wide local resection and prosthetic replacement and followed up for six to 17 years.\n Limb function was excellent in 85%.\n One patient with grade III histological disease developed pulmonary metastases.\n Four patients had local recurrences, which were related to repeated preliminary biopsies, inappropriate siting of biopsy and vascular encroachment by the tumour.\n After this mode of treatment, the outcome was not related to medullary invasion by the tumour.",
