  "text": "Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using allogeneic tendon. Long-term followup.\n Eighty-four patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with fresh-frozen allogeneic tendon were reviewed and evaluated with subjective and functional rating scales, physical examinations, instrumented anterior drawer tests, isokinetic testing, and arthroscopy.\n The average followup was 57 months (range, 36 to 90 months) and the average age at operation was 22 years (range, 16 to 37 years).\n The subjective and functional results were rated as excellent in 48 patients (57%), good in 31 (37%), and fair in 2 (2%).\n Three patients (3%) experienced a retear of the ACL.\n Physical examinations and instrumented anterior drawer tests showed that satisfactory anterior stability was restored in 88% of the patients.\n Isokinetic evaluations demonstrated that the extension torque of the involved knee recovered to a slightly lower level than that of the controls, although the flexion torque recovered to a level equivalent to that of the controls.\n Arthroscopic evaluations revealed that the allografts were elaborately remodeled, viable, and taut.\n There was no sign of immunologic rejection at any time postoperatively.\n Additional extraarticular procedures, consisting of both pes anserinus transfer on the medial side and iliotibial band reinforcement on the lateral side, had no effect on the results.",
