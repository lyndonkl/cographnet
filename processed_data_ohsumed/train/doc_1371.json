  "text": "Acute axonal polyneuropathy associated with anti-GM1 antibodies following Campylobacter enteritis.\n We report 2 patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following Campylobacter jejuni enteritis.\n Electrophysiologic studies indicated that the predominant process was axonal degeneration of motor nerves, and clinical recovery was poor.\n Serum testing by thin-layer chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the sera from both patients contained high titers of IgG antibody against GM1 ganglioside.\n These cases may represent a subgroup of GBS as acute axonal polyneuropathy following C jejuni enteritis associated with anti-GM1 antibodies.",
