  "text": "Cholecystectomy and right colon cancer in Puerto Rico.\n A case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the possible relationship between cholecystectomy and right colon cancer.\n Two hundred patients with adenocarcinoma of the cecum or ascending colon (diagnosed between 1984 and 1989) were compared with 200 matched neighborhood controls.\n Cholecystectomy history was obtained through interviews using structured questionnaires and subsequently validated from hospital records.\n A statistically significant association (odds ratio = 2.14) was found between right colon cancer and a history of prior cholecystectomy.\n The altered bile metabolism which occurs after removal of the gallbladder may have a carcinogenic effect on the right colon.\n Dietary habits of the colon cancer patients in our study were consistent with prior reports in the literature, showing that this group has a lower intake of vegetables and cereal fiber than the control population.",
