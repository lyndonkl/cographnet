  "text": "Cholesterol localization in ultrathin frozen sections in Schnyder's corneal crystalline dystrophy.\n We examined a 57-year-old woman who had bilateral corneal crystalline deposits associated with xanthelasma.\n The patient's son had bilateral stromal haze.\n Plasma cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and B levels were normal.\n Histopathologic examination disclosed lipid deposits, particularly in the superficial stroma and Bowman's layer.\n These deposits stained with oil red O and filipin, a fluorescent probe that specifically detects unesterified cholesterol.\n Cryoultramicrotomy disclosed more specific ultrastructural localization of unesterified cholesterol with an array of crystals resembling multiple plates in extracellular corneal tissue.",
