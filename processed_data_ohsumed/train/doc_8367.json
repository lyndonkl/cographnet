  "text": "Comparison of patellar resurfacing versus nonresurfacing in bilateral total knee arthroplasty.\n Twenty-five patients who received bilateral total knee prostheses were studied to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of patellar resurfacing.\n Only patients with advanced patellofemoral disease were included in the study.\n In all patients, patellar resurfacing had been done in the right knee but not in the left knee.\n The DePuy porous-coated implant was used in all cases.\n Subjective criteria were compared with objective criteria, which included range of motion, knee flexion and extension, and roentgenographic evaluation.\n The findings in this study suggest that patellar resurfacing can offer the patient a superior knee with regard to pain relief and strength.",
