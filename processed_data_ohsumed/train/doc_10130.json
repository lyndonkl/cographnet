  "text": "A five-year U.S. Army experience with 36,250 abdominal hernia repairs.\n Thirty-six thousand two hundred fifty abdominal hernia repairs were performed in U.S.\n Army medical treatment facilities during a five-year period.\n This study presents data about the type of hernia, incidence of complications by obstruction or strangulation, age, sex, and mortality.\n Hernias occurring with intestinal obstruction or gangrene (strangulation) are referred to as complicated hernias.\n Inguinal hernias in children less than two years of age, femoral hernias, and unusual (such as internal or obturator) hernias were found to have an increased incidence of complications.\n Surgical repair of ventral, umbilical, and femoral hernias was done with a low surgical risk and the presence of complications did not significantly increase this risk.\n An increased risk of mortality is associated with the repair of complicated unusual hernias and complicated inguinal hernias in patients more than 60 years of age.",
