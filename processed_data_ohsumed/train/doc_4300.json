  "text": "Temporary cardiac pacing using a new, steerable, balloon-tipped pacing catheter.\n A new balloon-tipped, flow-directed, steerable pacing catheter for unipolar temporary ventricular pacing is presented.\n It was successfully and uneventfully tested in 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction in the coronary care unit.\n The main advantage of the new catheter is the ease with which a stable contact may be achieved between the pacing electrode and the endocardium.",
