  "text": "Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease.\n We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease.\n A total of 29 abscesses were discovered.\n These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses.\n Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning.\n Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization.\n Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess.\n The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel.\n The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved.",
