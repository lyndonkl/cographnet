  "text": "Intravenous fluid load and recovery. A double-blind comparison in gynaecological patients who had day-case laparoscopy.\n The effect of intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration upon recovery was tested in a randomised, double-blind trial.\n Three groups of 25 patients, each undergoing laparoscopic examination as day cases, were studied.\n The two groups who received fluid (20 ml/kg compound sodium lactate solution) showed significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in the variables that reflected hydration.\n The fluid group who also received dextrose (1 g/kg) exhibited further significant improvement.\n Intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration appears to confer some benefit upon recovery in patients who have minor surgery.",
