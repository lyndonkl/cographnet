  "text": "Ocular syphilis.\n The ability of syphilis to mimic different ocular disorders can lead to misdiagnosis and delay in appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\n The authors describe their experience over the past 5 years with the ocular manifestations of syphilis in 25 patients who comprised 2.45% of 1020 new patients.\n Uveitis was the most common ocular manifestation seen.\n All patients had positive results from FTA-ABS tests, whereas only 68% had reactive serum VDRLs.\n Two of five patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody were reactive.\n The authors recommend routine FTA-ABS and VDRL screening in patients with uveitis or unexplained ocular inflammation.\n They also recommend testing for HIV antibody in luetics and aggressive treatment with high-dose aqueous penicillin for syphilis.",
