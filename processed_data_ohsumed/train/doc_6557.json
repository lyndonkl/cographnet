  "text": "Management of selected cystic adnexal masses in postmenopausal women by operative laparoscopy: a pilot study.\n Twenty-five postmenopausal patients were predicted to have benign masses by screening criteria that included ultrasonographic findings of a cystic adnexal mass less than 10 cm with distinct borders and no evidence of irregular solid parts, thick septa, ascites, or matted bowel, and a normal serum CA 125 value (less than 35 U/ml).\n All 25 masses were accurately predicted to be benign.\n The size of the cysts on ultrasonography ranged from 3 to 9 cm with a mean of 5 cm.\n Twenty-two patients (88%) were successfully managed by operative laparoscopy and adnexectomy.\n Mean operative time was 70 minutes and mean postoperative hospital stay was 12 hours.\n Mean time of return to normal activity was 5 days.\n Three patients required laparotomy.\n We conclude that removal of these cystic adnexal masses by operative laparoscopy is an acceptable alternative in carefully selected postmenopausal women.",
