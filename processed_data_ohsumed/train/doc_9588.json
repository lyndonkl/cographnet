  "text": "A random double-blind trial of the combination of nebulized atropine methylnitrate and albuterol in nocturnal asthma.\n The combination of nebulized atropine methylnitrate (AMN) and a beta-agonist has been shown to produce greater and longer lasting bronchodilation than either drug alone.\n We examined the efficacy of the combination in diminishing the \"morning dipping\" in PEFR in eight hospitalized but stable asthmatics.\n The patients received nebulized albuterol along with either AMN (AMN + ALB) or placebo (ALB) in a random double-blind cross-over fashion at 10 PM on four nights.\n PEFR and FEV1 were recorded at 6 PM, 10 PM, and 6 AM before the administration of bronchodilators.\n There was no statistically significant difference between ALB and AMN + ALB in reducing the morning dipping in these patients.",
